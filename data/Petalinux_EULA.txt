3.	License Grants.

	(a)	Xilinx Licenses.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Xilinx hereby grants to Licensee the following personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable licenses (under Xilinx' intellectual property rights as embodied in the applicable Software):

		(1)	Use.  Licensee may install and use the Software for the sole purposes of developing, synthesizing, testing and verifying designs only for use with Xilinx Devices.

		(2)	RESERVED.

		(3)	Distributable Components License.

			A.	Certain Definitions.  "Distributable Component(s)" means those files supplied by Xilinx that are contained within the Software and that are identified by Xilinx in such tool or its associated documentation as either (a) an IP core (or a LogiCORE product), which is designed for use in programming functionality onto a Xilinx Device (hereafter a "Core"), or (b) a software driver (or a device driver), which is designed for use in enabling a Xilinx Device to interoperate with other independent software programs such as an operating system as well as middleware, board support package (BSP) or other application software (collectively hereafter a "Driver").  Distributable Components may be supplied by Xilinx in either (y) source code form, such as a Core provided in VHDL or Verilog form or a Driver provided in C language source form (hereafter "Modifiable Form"), or (z) a format other than source code, such as a Core provided in netlist form or encrypted netlist form or a Driver provided in complied object code form (hereafter "Restricted Form").  For purposes of clarity, a "Core" as used herein includes only a "Core" provided by Xilinx in the Software tools listed above at no additional charge, and not any fee-based LogiCORE products which are licensed separately under other agreements.

			B.	Modification Rights.  For Distributable Components supplied by Xilinx in Modifiable Form, Licensee may modify such Distributable Components, provided that such modifications are limited to enabling such Distributable Components to, in the case of a Core, program only a Xilinx Device, and in the case of a Driver, enable only a Xilinx Device to interoperate with other independent software programs such as an operating system.  Licensee shall have no right to modify a Distributable Component that is supplied by Xilinx in a Restricted Form. 

			C.	Distribution Rights.  Licensee may distribute Distributable Components (including when modified per Section 3(a)(3)B (Modification Rights) above), provided that either (a) such Distributable Components have been converted into a machine executable form, such as in the case of a Core, a Bitstream, and in the case of a Driver, in compiled object code form; or (b) the recipient thereof has a valid license from Xilinx to use the same Software.  In all cases Distributable Components shall be distributed only for use to program a Xilinx Device.
       
	(b)	Third-Party Licenses.  Certain files, programs or other materials distributed in connection with the Software may originate from third-party licensors and are licensed to Licensee (not under the terms and conditions of this Agreement, but rather) pursuant to the terms and conditions of the applicable licenses that appear upon installation, acceptance and/or activation of the Software and/or are contained or described in the corresponding release notes or other documentation or header or source files.  Such files, programs or other materials may be subject to the terms of the GNU General Public License or other open source or free software licenses.  Licensee agrees to carefully review and abide by the terms and conditions of these licenses to the extent that they govern such files, programs or other materials.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, as between Xilinx and Licensee, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law and if not prohibited by any such third-party licenses, all such third-party files, programs or other materials shall be deemed covered under Sections 10 (Disclaimers) and 11 (Limitation of Liability) and 14(c) (Governing Law) of this Agreement.

4.	Restrictions.
     
	(a)	Special Use Restrictions.  No right is granted hereunder to use the Software or any Bitstream generated by use of the Software to program or develop designs for non-Xilinx Devices; however, Licensee may port ASIC designs to Xilinx Devices for the purpose of prototyping and verification.

	(b)	General Restrictions.  Except only to the extent otherwise expressly allowed under Section 3 (License Grants) above (or under applicable laws notwithstanding these restrictions), Licensee is not licensed to, and agrees not to: (i) decompile, translate, reverse-engineer, disassemble, or otherwise reduce to human readable form the Software or the data files generated by the Software; (ii) transmit the Software or display the object code of the Software on any computer screen, or make any hard-copy memory dumps of the object code; (iii) publish or disclose the results of any benchmarking of the Software, or use such results for any other software development activities; (iv) make any copies of the Software, except to make one (1) copy of the Software in machine-readable form solely for backup purposes; (v) modify or prepare derivative works of the Software, in whole or in part; (vi) hypothecate, rent, lease, loan, lend, time-share, sublicense, distribute or otherwise transfer the Software to any other individual, corporation or other legal entity; or (vii) remove, alter or obscure any product identification, ownership or intellectual property rights notices on or in the Software.

5.	RESERVED.

6.	Ownership.  Licensee acknowledges and agrees that all intellectual property and industrial rights in and to the Software and all copies thereof are and will remain the sole property of Xilinx (or its licensors, as applicable).  Nothing contained in this Agreement will be construed as conferring by implication, estoppel or otherwise upon Licensee any license or other right except the licenses and rights expressly granted to Licensee in Section 3 (License Grants).  The Software is protected by laws and international treaty provisions covering intellectual property rights.  With respect to any files, programs or other materials distributed in connection with the Software that have been licensed to Xilinx from third parties and which are not governed by a separate license as mentioned in Section 3(b) (Third-Party Licenses) above, such third parties are intended third-party beneficiaries of the terms of this Agreement.

7.	Confidentiality. Except as otherwise expressly permitted in Section 3 (License Grants), Licensee shall (a) maintain the confidentiality of the Software as the proprietary trade secrets of Xilinx (or its licensors, as applicable); and (b) not make the Software available in any form to any person other than to its Users who have a genuine "need to know" for purposes authorized by this Agreement, and who are bound by obligations of confidentiality no less protective of Xilinx (or its licensors, as applicable) than those contained herein.  Licensee represents to Xilinx that it maintains a system of confidentiality consistent with commonly accepted practices in the semiconductor industry to protect its own confidential business information, including written agreements with its Users, and that the Software will be protected by such a system to the same extent, but in no event with less than reasonable care.  Licensee agrees that a breach of this Agreement may result in irreparable and continuing damage to Xilinx for which there may be no adequate remedy at law, and Xilinx shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief and/or a decree for specific performance, and such other relief (including monetary damages) as may be proper.

8.	Updates; Support.  Any Updates that are provided to Licensee shall be deemed and treated the same as the "Software" under this Agreement for which such Update applies.  Also, any support (whether provided via the Xilinx technical support website or otherwise) for the Software provided to Licensee shall be governed by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

9.	RESERVED.

10.	DISCLAIMERS.

FURTHERMORE, THE SOFTWARE IS NOT DESIGNED OR INTENDED FOR USE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY APPLICATIONS THAT AFFECT CONTROL OF A VEHICLE OR AIRCRAFT, UNLESS THERE IS A FAIL-SAFE OR REDUNDANCY FEATURE (WHICH DOES NOT INCLUDE USE OF SOFTWARE IN THE XILINX DEVICE TO IMPLEMENT THE REDUNDANCY) AND A WARNING SIGNAL UPON FAILURE TO THE OPERATOR.  LICENSEE AGREES, PRIOR TO USING OR DISTRIBUTING ANY SYSTEMS THAT WERE DEVELOPED BY USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR THAT INCORPORATE ANY PORTION OF THE SOFTWARE, TO THOROUGHLY TEST THE SAME FOR SAFETY PURPOSES.
