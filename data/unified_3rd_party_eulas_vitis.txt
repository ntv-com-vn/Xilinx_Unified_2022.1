Part One: Overview.

The following information applies to certain items of third-party technology that are included along with certain Xilinx software tools.

Licensee's use of the GNU compilers (including associated libraries and utilities) may cause Licensee's software application (or board-support package) to be governed by certain third-party "open source" license agreements, as further described below.  Licensee can avoid this result by using alternative compilers, libraries, and utilities of its own choosing in lieu of the GNU compilers (and associated libraries and utilities). 
 
Note:  Licensee is solely responsible for checking the header files and other accompanying source files of all software applications created from the use of the GNU compliers (and associated libraries and utilities) because such header and/or source files may contain or describe various copyright notices and license terms and conditions governing such files, which vary from case to case based on Licensee's usage and are beyond the control of Xilinx.  This summary and the license information provided below is for reference purposes and is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all copyright notices or third-party license terms and conditions applicable to Xilinx software tools.  Licensee is solely responsible for complying with the terms and conditions imposed by third parties as applicable to the Licensee's software applications created from the use of the GNU compilers (and associated libraries and utilities).
 

The remainder of this document is organized into various parts, as follows:

     Licenses and Notices:

This version: http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/copyright-software-20021231

This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on December 31 2002. This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that this license can be used with materials other than those owned by the W3C, reflects that ERCIM is now a host of the W3C, includes references to this specific dated version of the license, and removes the ambiguous grant of "use". Otherwise, this version is the same as the previous version and is written so as to preserve the Free Software Foundation's assessment of GPL compatibility and OSI's certification under the Open Source Definition

This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on December 31 2002. This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that this license can be used with materials other than those owned by the W3C, reflects that ERCIM is now a host of the W3C, includes references to this specific dated version of the license, and removes the ambiguous grant of "use". Otherwise, this version is the same as the previous version and is written so as to preserve the Free Software Foundation's assessment of GPL compatibility and OSI's certification under the Open Source Definition

ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/ should also be given in
the documentation. However, this condition is not intended to apply to whole

package B is software that includes package A, the condition is not imposed on
package B (unless it uses PCRE independently). 3. Altered versions must be

Copyright (c) 1984, Sun Microsystems, Inc. These routines interface XDRSTREAMS to a
tcp/ip connection. There is a record marking layer between the xdr stream and
the tcp transport level. A record is composed on one or more record fragments. A
record fragment is a thirty-two bit header followed by n bytes of data, where n
is contained in the header. The header is represented as a htonl(u_long). Thegh
order bit encodes whether or not the fragment is the last fragment of the record
(1 > fragment is last, 0 > more fragments to follow. The other 31 bits encode
the byte length of the fragment. /

Synopsys ASIP Programmer files version R-2021.03-TGT-211109
<<<<<<<<<<xilinx-separator>>>>>>>>>>

The Synopsys ASIP Programmer and ASIP files are subject to the following End-User Software License and Maintenance Agreement, by accepting these terms and using such ASIP Programmer and ASIP files, (1) you agree to be bound by these terms, and (2) you acknowledge that Synopsys has no obligation to provide support to you in connection with your use of such ASIP Programmer and ASIP files. 

END-USER SOFTWARE LICENSE AND MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
This agreement covers the products and services you license (or purchase) from Synopsys, unless and until we enter into a new agreement that expressly replaces this one.  If you use the Synopsys products and services as an employee of or for the benefit of your company, you represent that you have the power and authority to accept this agreement on behalf of your company.  Your company will be the licensee under this agreement.   By clicking on the “Accept” button of this agreement, or by downloading, installing or using the Synopsys products or services, you consent to the terms and conditions of this agreement on behalf of yourself and the company on whose behalf you will use the Synopsys products and services provided under this agreement.  The effective date of this agreement is the date that you first download, install or use the Synopsys products or services. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this agreement or if you do not have the power and authority to accept the terms and conditions of this agreement on behalf of your company, you may not use the Synopsys products and services and Synopsys is unwilling to provide you with them.


Products and Services
1.1. The Synopsys products and services that you may license or purchase under this agreement are identified in the Purchasing Agreements that you and Synopsys enter into from time to time under this agreement.  These products and services may include (but are not limited to):
(a) DesignWare, which means any software products (including Implementation IP and Verification IP), other than DesignWare Fee-Per-Use Cores, marketed by Synopsys under the brand name “DesignWare”.
(b) Licensed Software, which means a Synopsys software product other than DesignWare and DesignWare Fee-Per-Use Cores.
(c) Maintenance Services, which means the software maintenance and support services described in section 5.
(d) Training Services, which means education in the use of Synopsys software products through standard curriculum educational services courses.
1.2. The term “Licensed Products” means Licensed Software and DesignWare.
1.3. Additional terms and conditions (beyond those stated here and in any attached supplements) may apply to certain Licensed Products.  When ordering these Licensed Products, you will be given an opportunity to review the additional terms and conditions that must be accepted for you to receive the Licensed Products.  If the additional terms and conditions conflict in any way with the terms and conditions stated here, the additional terms and conditions will prevail.
Licenses
1.4. Your License Rights:  When you purchase a license (other than an evaluation license) to a Licensed Product, upon its delivery you will have a nonexclusive right to:
(a) install the Licensed Product on one or more computers;
(b) install the License Key for the Licensed Product on the computer specifically identified in the License Key;
(c) allow your End Users to use the Licensed Product and Design Techniques, during the License Term, solely for the purpose of creating, modifying, and simulating your own Designs (in the case of DesignWare, this includes validating, testing, and simulating Designs, electronic circuits and devices);
(d) in the case of DesignWare, share Design Databases with a Licensed Design Partner only to allow the Licensed Design Partner to work cooperatively on your Design to the extent permitted by its own DesignWare license (but not sublicense or assign any of your rights in the DesignWare to such Licensed Design Partner);
(e) in the case of ARC Software Development Products, use this Licensed Product, during the License Term, solely for the purpose of creating, debugging, and profiling executable software source code for execution on a System-on-Chip with an embedded ARC microprocessor or on a model of such System-on-Chip;
(f) in the case of ARC MQX Products, until you discontinue the sale and distribution of the applicable ARC MQX Licensee Products, use the ARC MQX Products to (i) customize the Board Support Package Features in the ARC MQX Product solely as necessary for use with your ARC MQX Licensee Product; (ii) create and support an ARC MQX Licensee Executable; (iii) if you have purchased a license to the “closed system license” version of an ARC MQX Product, then you may distribute, solely in or with an ARC MQX Licensee Product, an ARC MQX Licensee Executable that does not expose, directly or indirectly, any APIs of the ARC MQX Product; and (iv) if you have purchased a license to the “binary” version of an ARC MQX Product, then you may additionally distribute to ARC MQX End Customers only that portion of the Documentation necessary for ARC MQX End Customers to access the APIs, provided that such ARC MQX End Customers are obligated not to expose any of the APIs to their customers or any other third parties.
(g) make a reasonable number of copies of the Licensed Product solely for backup or archival purposes; and
(h) make a reasonable number of copies of the Documentation for the Licensed Product, and use the Documentation solely to support your use of the Licensed Product.
1.5. Implementation IP License:  In addition, when you are granted a license to any Implementation IP, you will have a nonexclusive right to:
(a) integrate the Implementation IP into your Designs to create one or more Integrated Designs; 
(b) make, use, and sell physical implementations (commonly referred to as semiconductor chips) of one or more of the Integrated Designs;
(c) distribute the Implementation IP in netlist or GDSII format as part of any of your Integrated Designs to any third party that provides foundry services to you, solely for the purpose of having that foundry make physical implementations of one or more of entire Integrated Designs of yours, as long as the third-party foundry is subject to confidentiality obligations regarding the Implementation IP that are no less restrictive than the confidentiality obligations in this agreement; and
(d) if you purchased from Synopsys the right to use certain Implementation IP in source code format, you may modify that Implementation IP in support of your development of Integrated Designs.
1.6. Node-Locked License.  If you have obtained the Licensed Product under a node-locked license, then a “node” refers to a specific machine and the License Product may be installed only on the number of nodes indicated on the applicable Synopsys Purchasing Agreement, must be used only on the node(s) on which it is installed, and may be accessed only by users who are physically present at that node.  Further, a node-locked license may only be used by one (1) user at a time running one (1) instance of the Licensed Product at a time.
1.7. Evaluation Licenses:  If you obtain an evaluation license for a Licensed Product, you will have the same license rights as described above except that you may use the Licensed Product only for the purpose of evaluating it and deciding whether to purchase a license to use it for production purposes.  You shall not use the Licensed Product to design any integrated circuits for production or pre-production purposes or any other commercial use including, but not limited to, for the benefit of your customers.  If you breach the forgoing restrictions, then you shall pay to Synopsys a license fee equal to Synopsys’s perpetual list price plus maintenance for the commercial version of the Licensed Product.  You agree that damages for such a breach would be difficult to assess, and such payment represents a reasonable assessment of the potential damage to Synopsys.  You recognized and agree that this amount is a reasonable, liquidated amount and not a penalty. Also, evaluation copies of Licensed Products are provided “AS IS”.  Therefore the warranty and indemnification provisions in this agreement do not apply to evaluation licenses.
1.8. End Users: You may designate any of your employees whose primary work location is in the designated Use Area as End Users.  
1.9. Use Area; Telecommuting Employees; Use Over a WAN:  You must ensure that your End Users use the Licensed Product only when they are in the designated Use Area, except that any End User who is your employee, whose primary work location is in the designated Use Area, and whose primary residence is within 50 miles of the designated Use Area, may access the Licensed Product from his primary residence through a secure network that requires a secure ID card or other more protective security safeguards.  If you have purchased the right to use a Licensed Product over your wide area network (commonly referred to as a “WAN”), then unless the Purchasing Agreement states otherwise, the Licensed Product may be used by your End Users who are located at any of your facilities worldwide (if you purchased the right to use over a global WAN) or at any of your facilities on the same continent on which your Key Server is located (if you purchased the right to use over a continental WAN). This section 2.6 does not apply to Licensed Products obtained under a node-locked license as referenced in section 2.3.
1.10. Key Servers; Hardware Relocation: You may not permanently relocate a Key Server outside of the designated Use Area without obtaining written approval from Synopsys.  If a Key Server becomes inoperative due to malfunction, repair, or maintenance, you may request Synopsys’s permission to set up and temporarily use a single back-up Key Server on another computer in the same Use Area until the original Key Server returns to service.
1.11. Conditions:  Your right to use the Licensed Product is conditioned upon your timely payment of the full amount of Fees due for the Licensed Product and your compliance with the terms and conditions of this agreement.  When the License Term expires, your license rights also expire and you may no longer use the Licensed Product.
1.12. Restrictions:  You may not (and may not allow anyone else to):
(a) copy or use any Licensed Product (or Documentation) in any manner that is not expressly allowed by the license rights stated above;
(b) decompile, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for any Licensed Product or any underlying algorithms, user interface techniques, or other ideas embodied in a Licensed Product;
(c) tamper with, or attempt to circumvent or disable, any License Key (this includes, for example, resetting the CPU time in order to extend the License Term, or using a false host ID number or additional virtualized copy(ies) of the host ID number to enable unauthorized copies of a License Key);
(d) distribute any copy of a Licensed Product (or Documentation) except as expressly allowed by the license rights stated above, or allow anyone other than your End Users to have access to or use (such as in a timesharing, service bureau, or application service provider model) any Licensed Product;
(e) use a Licensed Product (except ARC MQX Products) or its output to create, modify, or simulate Designs for third parties;
(f) use a Licensed Product or its output to develop or enhance any product that competes with a Synopsys product;
(g) modify or create a derivative work of any part of a Licensed Product or Documentation;
(h) disclose the results of any benchmarking of a Licensed Product (whether or not the results were obtained with assistance from Synopsys) to any third party; or
(i) use a Licensed Product in the development of any product if the failure or malfunction of that product could reasonably be expected to result in personal injury, death, or catastrophic loss.
If the License Key limits the number of End Users who may use a Licensed Product simultaneously or the number of simultaneous Clients, you must ensure that this limit is not exceeded, by platform virtualization or any other means.
1.13. Copies:  If you make backup or archival copies of a Licensed Product or Documentation, you must reproduce all copyright, trademark, and other notices that appear on the original copy.
1.14. Transfers and Assignments: You may not transfer or assign your license rights to any other person in any manner (by assignment, operation of law or otherwise) unless you have obtained written consent from Synopsys.  If you attempt to transfer or assign any of your license rights without Synopsys’s consent, the transfer or assignment will be ineffective, null, and void (and you will be in material breach of this agreement).  For purposes of this section 2.11, a transfer or assignment of your license rights will be deemed to have occurred (a) if a third party (or group of third parties acting in concert) acquires beneficial ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of either (i) your or a Parent Entity’s assets or (ii) the stock or other equity interests entitled to vote for your or a Parent Entity’s directors or equivalent managing authority, or (b) in the event of a merger, consolidation or other business combination between you or a Parent Entity and one or more third parties where your or a Parent Entity’s stockholders immediately before that transaction own (directly or indirectly), after that transaction, less than fifty percent (50%) of the stock or other equity interests entitled to vote for the directors or equivalent managing authority of the surviving entity.
1.15. Open Source Software: The Licensed Product may be delivered with software that is subject to open source licensing terms (“Open Source Software”), which terms are available upon request. Certain Open Source Software licenses require that source code be made available upon request. Licensee may request a copy of such source code by post to Synopsys at: Synopsys, Inc., Attention: Open Source Software Requests, 690 East Middlefield Road, Mountain View, California 94043, USA. Licensee agrees that all Open Source Software shall be and shall remain subject to the terms and conditions under which it is provided. The Open Source Software is provided “AS IS,” WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND SYNOPSYS FURTHER DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, WITH RESPECT TO OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. NEITHER SYNOPSYS NOR THE LICENSORS OF OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  Copyrights to the Open Source Software are held by the copyright holders indicated in the copyright notices in the corresponding source files.

Synopsys may, in its reasonable discretion, accept or reject your order.  Synopsys may accept your order by sending you written or electronic notice of acceptance or simply by fulfilling your order.
1.17. Delivery:  If Synopsys accepts your order for one or more Licensed Products, Synopsys will then deliver to you the Licensed Products along with the corresponding Documentation and License Keys.  Synopsys will deliver these materials to you electronically except where prohibited by law.
1.18. Electronic Software Transfer:  When Synopsys delivers a Licensed Product by electronic software transfer, Synopsys will send you an e-mail to your designated e-mail address(es) to notify you that the Licensed Product is available.  Synopsys’s obligation to deliver the Licensed Product will be fulfilled when this e-mail notice is sent.  You will be responsible for downloading or requesting for delivery the Licensed Product and Documentation from the FTP Server and the License Key from Synopsys’s website at www.synopsys.com, unless Synopsys gives you other instructions.  You must notify Synopsys in writing if you change your designated e-mail address(es).
1.19. Tangible Media:  When Synopsys delivers Licensed Products to you on tangible media, the media may contain other software programs in addition to the Licensed Products.  If it does, you will not have a license to use (and the License Keys for the Licensed Products will not permit you to use) these other software programs, and you must not attempt to access, use, reproduce, modify, reverse engineer, or otherwise tamper with these other software programs.  If you lose or damage the media, Synopsys will, at your request, provide a replacement at a nominal charge.  All deliveries of tangible items by Synopsys, Inc. will be made F.O.B.

1.21. Payments:  If the applicable Purchasing Agreement does not contain specific payment terms for the Fees in question, payment of those Fees will be due within 30 days after the date of Synopsys’s invoice.  If you do not pay an amount by the scheduled due date, Synopsys will have the right to withhold the delivery of License Keys and/or terminate this agreement or a Purchasing Agreement and accelerate the due date of all remaining payments.  In this event, you will owe the entire outstanding balance as soon as you receive written notice from Synopsys that your payment is due.  All payments you make to Synopsys are non-refundable.  You may not offset any amounts you believe Synopsys owes you against any payments you make to Synopsys under this agreement.  You must make payments in U.S. dollars.  If you do not pay an amount by the due date, you must also pay a late payment charge of 1.5% per month or the highest rate permitted by law, whichever is less.
1.22. Taxes:  You will be solely responsible for paying all taxes (including sales, use, consumption, withholding, and value-added taxes and similar taxes), other than Synopsys’s income taxes, that are imposed on or result from your purchase, license, or use of Synopsys products and services.  If Synopsys is required by law to collect and remit any such taxes, Synopsys may invoice you for such taxes and you agree to pay the invoiced amount to Synopsys.  If you are required by the respective jurisdiction where the Licensed Products are used, or where services are provided, to withhold taxes from payments to Synopsys, you may withhold from the total amount due to the respective Synopsys distributing entity the minimum amount required (but no more).  You may only withhold taxes related to a payment at the time of such payment.  You must then promptly pay that amount to the appropriate tax authority and provide Synopsys with an official receipt for the payment within 60 days of your payment.
1.23. Bankruptcy:  If you become the subject of any bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation, or similar proceedings or make a general assignment for the benefit of your creditors, Synopsys may apply any payments you have previously made to Synopsys for products or services not yet delivered by Synopsys against any amounts you owe Synopsys at that time for products or services that have been delivered by Synopsys (under this agreement or otherwise).

(a) Support:  Synopsys will provide you with access to SolvNet and online Documentation, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to make available the Synopsys Support Center on Monday through Friday, during Synopsys’s normal business hours, excluding Synopsys’s scheduled holidays. A valid corporate email address is required to access SolvNet and online Documentation.
(b) Updates:  Synopsys will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Updates as they become generally available.  Any other upgrades or enhancements to the Licensed Products are not made available by Synopsys as part of Maintenance Services and may be subject to additional charges.

(a) you must have purchased Maintenance Services for such Licensed Product (unless it is licensed under a TSL, in which case Maintenance Services are included);

1.27. Exclusions:  Synopsys will have no obligation to provide Maintenance Services for any Licensed Products that are damaged, modified (by anyone other than Synopsys), incorporated into other software, or installed in any computing environment not supported by Synopsys; or for any version of a Licensed Product other than the latest and immediately preceding version; or for any problems caused by your negligence, abuse, misuse, or by any causes beyond Synopsys’s reasonable control.
1.28. Reinstatement of Maintenance Services:  If Maintenance Services are terminated for any reason, or if you wish to renew Maintenance Services more than thirty (30) days after Maintenance Services have been terminated, you may be permitted to reinstate or renew Maintenance Services, at Synopsys’s sole option, provided that (a) Synopsys offers Maintenance Services to its customers generally for the Licensed Product in question, and (b) you pay Synopsys the following: all applicable Maintenance Services fees for the period during which you were off Maintenance Services, and Synopsys’s then-current reinstatement fee plus payment for the new Maintenance Services term.
1.29. ViewConnect:  If you wish to permit Synopsys to deliver Maintenance Services through the use of a shared customer desktop, you must download and install the ViewConnect Tool and related publicly-available, third-party software modules. You are not required to use the ViewConnect Tool, but if you choose to do so, you have the nonexclusive right to use the ViewConnect Tool only to enable Synopsys to remotely access your computer system for the purpose of providing Maintenance Services.  Your rights to the third-party software modules are separately described in their accompanying license terms.  The ViewConnect Tool and the third-party software modules are not Licensed Products nor is their use governed by this agreement.
5.7. Training Services:  Synopsys offers Training Services, which may be purchased and ordered through the online registration system found at www.synopsys.com.   
Confidentiality
1.30. Confidentiality Obligations:  Each party (you and Synopsys) agrees to abide by the following confidentiality obligations with respect to the other party’s Confidential Information:
(a) do not disclose it to any third party unless (i) the other party has given its specific and express prior written approval, (ii) the disclosure is expressly allowed under this agreement, or (iii) the disclosure is necessary to comply with a valid court order or subpoena;
(b) do not use it for any reason other than to exercise its rights and perform its obligation under this agreement; and
(c) protect it from unauthorized dissemination in the same manner as that party protects its own Confidential Information, and in any event with reasonable precautions (which include limiting access to employees and contractors on a “need-to-know” basis).
1.31. Mandatory Disclosures:  If you believe you must disclose Synopsys’s Confidential Information in order to comply with a valid court order or subpoena, you must promptly notify Synopsys and cooperate with Synopsys if Synopsys chooses to contest the disclosure requirement, seek confidential treatment of the information to be disclosed, or to limit the nature or scope of the information to be disclosed.  Synopsys will do the same if it believes it must disclose your Confidential Information in these circumstances.
1.32. Additional Obligations: In addition to your general obligations of confidentiality regarding the Licensed Products and Documentation, you must take the following steps to help prevent any unauthorized access to or use of the same:
(a) you must ensure that each End User who is your independent contractor (not your employee) has access to and uses the Licensed Products and Documentation only while working on your physical premises; and
(b) you must monitor each End User’s use of the Licensed Products to ensure that the End User abides by the terms of this agreement.
Term and Termination
1.33. Term of Agreement:  The term of this agreement will begin on the effective date stated on the signature page and will end when the last Purchasing Agreement expires, unless this agreement is terminated sooner by either party.
1.34. Term of Purchasing Agreement: Each Purchasing Agreement will have its own term, as indicated on that Purchasing Agreement.
1.35. Rights to Terminate:  Each party has the right to terminate this agreement, by giving written notice of termination to the other party, if (a) the other party breaches this agreement and (b) either the breach cannot be cured or, if the breach can be cured, it is not cured by the breaching party within 15 days after receiving written notice of the breach from the non-breaching party.  An Error will not be considered a breach of this agreement that allows you to terminate the agreement, but it could give rise to a warranty claim under section 8.
1.36. Consequences of Termination:  If and when either you or Synopsys terminates this agreement, all Purchasing Agreements in effect at that time will also terminate.  When this agreement, a Purchasing Agreement or an individual license to a Licensed Product expires or is terminated:
(a) you must (i) immediately cease all use of the Licensed Products, Documentation, Design Techniques, and other Confidential Information, (ii) promptly return to Synopsys or destroy all copies of the Licensed Products, Documentation, and other Confidential Information in your possession or control, and (iii) certify in writing to Synopsys that you have complied with clauses (i) and (ii), except, however, that your license to Implementation IP incorporated into Designs prior to termination shall continue according to its terms;
(b) you will remain obligated to pay any amounts you owe to Synopsys at that time; and
(c) the provisions of sections 4, 6, 7.4, 8.4 and 10, and the warranty disclaimers in section 8, will remain in effect.
Limited Warranty
1.37. Warranty:  For a period of 90 days from when Synopsys delivers a Licensed Product to you (the “warranty period”), Synopsys warrants that the Licensed Product will have no Errors when used on the correct platform and according to the instructions in the corresponding Documentation.  This warranty will be void if you, or anyone else other than Synopsys, modifies or attempts to modify the Licensed Product.
1.38. Warranty Claims:  To claim a breach of this warranty, you must, during the warranty period, notify Synopsys in writing of the Error or Errors that you have encountered and provide Synopsys with all the information you have, in written or electronic form, about those Errors, so that Synopsys can attempt to reproduce, diagnose, and correct the Errors.
1.39. Exclusive Remedy:  Your exclusive remedy for any breach of this warranty is that Synopsys will use commercially reasonable efforts to (at Synopsys’s option) correct the Errors you have reported or provide a replacement product that does not contain these Errors, or if Synopsys is unable to provide a correction or a replacement or determines that it will not be feasible to do so, Synopsys will refund the Fees you paid for that Licensed Product.
1.40. Disclaimer:  Except for the warranty in this Section 8, all Licensed Products, Documentation, Design Techniques, and any third party software are provided “AS IS,” without any other warranties of any kind.  Synopsys further disclaims all other warranties (express, implied, or statutory), including any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, or non-infringement and any warranties arising from a course of dealing or usage of trade.
Infringement Claims
1.41. Indemnity:  Synopsys will, at its own expense, be entitled to defend (or at its sole option, settle) any claim asserted against you by a third party that any Licensed Product you obtained from Synopsys under this agreement directly infringes any U.S. patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret.  Synopsys will indemnify you for any damages you suffer and costs you reasonably incur that are directly attributable to any such claim and that are assessed against you in a final, non-appealable judgment or agreed upon by Synopsys in a settlement.
1.42. Conditions:  Synopsys’s obligations to defend and indemnify you with respect to a particular claim are subject to the following conditions:
(a) you must promptly give Synopsys written notice of the claim;
(b) you must identify the specific Licensed Product(s) at issue in the claim and indicate how the Licensed Product(s) is(are) utilized by you or your products;
(c) you must give Synopsys sole control and authority over the defense and settlement of the claim; and
(d) you must provide Synopsys with all information you have regarding the claim and cooperate with Synopsys when Synopsys defends or attempts to settle the claim.
1.43. Pro-Active Steps:  If any Licensed Product is, or Synopsys believes is likely to become, the subject of a claim for which Synopsys would be obligated to defend and indemnify you, then Synopsys may, at its option, do any of the following:
(a) obtain for you (at no cost to you) the right for you to continue using the Licensed Product as permitted by this agreement;
(b) replace or modify the Licensed Product to avoid the infringement problem, as long as there is no material loss of functionality; or
(c) if Synopsys reasonably concludes that it will not be feasible to do either of the above, terminate your license for the Licensed Product and give you a prorated refund (based on how much of the License Term has elapsed) of the Fees you paid for that license.
1.44. Exclusions:  Synopsys will have no obligation to defend or indemnify you (notwithstanding the first paragraph of this section) with respect to any claim that is based on or attributable to any of the following:
(a) any modification made to the Licensed Product by anyone other than Synopsys;
(b) the combination or use of the Licensed Product with other products, processes, or materials not supplied by Synopsys or specified in the Documentation as being necessary to use the Licensed Product;
(c) your continued engagement in infringing activities after you were notified of the infringement or after Synopsys informed you of a modification or workaround that would have avoided the infringement; and

1.50. Limitation of Liability: For each product or service you license or purchase from Synopsys under this agreement, Synopsys’s total, cumulative liability to you, including under section 9, is limited to the amount of Fees you paid for that product or service (regardless of the nature of the liability or the nature or number of claims giving rise to the liability).  Synopsys will not, under any circumstances or any theory of liability, be liable to you for any lost profits, loss of data, or consequential, incidental, or special damages arising from this agreement or the products and services provided to you under this agreement.  However, this disclaimer of Synopsys’s liability for consequential damages does not limit or reduce Synopsys’s obligations to defend and indemnify you under section 9.  The limitations of liability in this section are a fundamental part of this agreement and enable Synopsys to provide products and services to you at lower prices.  These limitations of liability are intended to apply even if an exclusive remedy is found to have failed of its essential purpose.
1.51. Export Controls: You shall remain familiar with your obligations under any and all laws, statutes, regulations, ordinances of any local, states, federal, national, or other jurisdictional locality, as applicable to the export, import, and/or end-use of Synopsys products, technology, and services.  Products and/or technology sold under this agreement may be subject to various Export Control Laws and Regulations including but not limited to, U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR), the U.S. Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC), the European Union (EU) Export Control Regime Regulation (EC) No. 428/2009, and/or the EU Consolidated Sanctions List.  Where a product and/or technology is identified as export controlled from the country(ies) of export to (1) the destination country(ies), (2) a restricted/proscribed end use, and/or (3) a restricted end user, a government-issued export license must be obtained prior to fulfillment under this agreement and in accordance with all applicable laws.  You agree that Synopsys shall not be required to complete delivery of export controlled products or technology unless and until all required export licenses have been obtained. 
1.52. Governing Law; Jurisdiction: This agreement is governed by the laws of the United States and the State of California, without regard to conflicts of laws principles.

A copy of any communication sent to Synopsys must also be sent to the attention of the General Counsel.
1.54. Waivers: Either party’s failure to enforce any provision of this agreement will not be deemed a waiver of the future enforcement of that provision or enforcement of any other provision.  In order to be binding, a waiver must be in writing and signed by the party giving the waiver.
1.55. Independent Contractors: The parties to this agreement are independent contractors.  Neither party is the agent or partner of the other party, or has any power or authority to act on behalf of the other party.
1.56. Severability: If any provision in this agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable as written, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect and the invalid or unenforceable provision is to be construed (and, if necessary, modified) so that it is valid and enforceable to the greatest extent possible.
1.57. Attorneys’ Fees: The prevailing party in any action to enforce this agreement will be entitled to recover costs and expenses including reasonable attorneys’ fees.
1.58. Remedies: Except where this agreement expressly provides exclusive remedies, all rights and remedies of either party (including termination rights) are cumulative.

(c) you provide those designs and specifications to the manufacturer only for the purpose of making the Licensee ICs for you, and subject to confidentiality provisions that are at least as protective as those in this agreement; and
(d) you do not give source code for any Core Software to the manufacturer.
2.5  Hard IP Cores.  If you license any Cores that are Hard IP Cores, you understand that you may be required to obtain appropriate licenses to technology libraries (such as standard cell and I/O libraries) from a supplier of such libraries, and that if this is case, you are responsible for getting these licenses at your own cost.  You also agree that you may not make Modifications to Hard IP Cores without first obtaining Synopsys’ prior written consent.  Your use of each Hard IP Core is limited to the applicable manufacturer and process node specified in the Purchasing Agreement, and you may not use the Hard IP Core for any other manufacturer or process node.
2.6  Ownership:  The Core Software and all Modifications (including all Intellectual Property Rights in them) are owned by Synopsys and its licensors.  If you have any rights in any Modifications, you hereby irrevocably assign ownership of those Modifications (and all Intellectual Property Rights in them) to Synopsys.  However, you are under no obligation to actually disclose any such Modifications to Synopsys, and they will automatically be licensed to you as “Core Software” pursuant to section 2.1.  There are no implied licenses granted under this agreement, and all rights not expressly granted to you are reserved to Synopsys. 
2.7 Conditions:  Your right to use the Core Software is conditioned upon your timely payment of the full amount of Fees due for the Core Software (if any) and your compliance with the terms of this agreement, including the following restrictions.  For Core Software with a license term, when the license term expires your license rights also expire and you may no longer use the Core Software.

If Synopsys is required by law to collect and remit any such taxes, Synopsys may invoice you for such taxes and you agree to pay the invoiced amount to Synopsys.  If you are required by the respective jurisdiction where the Core Software are used, or where services are provided, to withhold taxes from payments to Synopsys, you may withhold from the total amount due to the respective Synopsys distributing entity the minimum amount required (but no more).  You may only withhold taxes related to a payment at the time of such payment.  You must then promptly pay that amount to the appropriate tax authority and provide Synopsys with an official receipt for the payment within 60 days of your payment.
4.4 Bankruptcy:  If you become the subject of any bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation, or similar proceedings or make a general assignment for the benefit of your creditors, Synopsys may apply any payments you have previously made to Synopsys for products or services not yet delivered by Synopsys against any amounts you owe Synopsys at that time for products or services that have been delivered by Synopsys (under this agreement or otherwise).
4.5 Royalty Reporting and Payment:  If royalties are applicable, then within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter following the effective date of this agreement, you will submit a royalty report to Synopsys via email to royalty@synopsys.com, on a form approved by Synopsys, that accurately sets forth the number of units of each Licensee IC that you sold, distributed, or otherwise disposed of during that quarter, along with payment of all reported amounts.  You are to submit a royalty report even during quarters where you report no sales, distributions, or disposals of Licensee ICs.  Note that you will continue to be obligated to make royalty reports and pay royalties until you permanently discontinue sales or distributions of the applicable Licensee IC.  In the event of such a discontinuation, you will provide Synopsys with a written certification that the Licensee IC has been discontinued, along with a final royalty report for the applicable Licensee IC.

5.  Core Support Services
5.1  Core Support Services:  Core Support Services, for the first 12 months after the initial delivery of the Core Software, are included in the price of a Use of the Core Software.  In providing Core Support Services, Synopsys will use commercially reasonable efforts to perform the following:
(a) provide you with bug-fix releases to the extent necessary to conform the Core Software to any applicable technical standard specification that was in existence at the time the Core Software was delivered to you;
(b) provide you with workarounds for material errors in the Core Software;
(c) provide you with 24/7 access to electronic assistance regarding the operation of the Core Software, as Synopsys may make available from time to time (such as through the SolvNet online web support service);
(d) if electronic assistance does not yield an appropriate resolution, give you access to a reasonable amount of telephone support for the Core Software, during normal business hours, through your designated support contact; and
(e) deliver bulletins as they are released by Synopsys from time to time, which contain information on bug-fix releases, application techniques, and workarounds for the Core Software.
5.2  Designated Support Contacts:  You may appoint up to 4 designated support contacts for each supported Licensee IC, and will give Synopsys the names of all designated support contacts before making initial contact with the Synopsys support center.  All technical communications, information, and materials exchanged between you and Synopsys regarding the Core Software will be conducted through your designated support contacts.  You may change any designated support contact at any time by notifying Synopsys.
5.3  Limitations.  The Core Support Services described in this section are the only services that Synopsys makes available for the Core Software, and no other warranties or support and maintenance services apply. Synopsys has no obligation to provide support for Core Software that has been altered, damaged, or modified by you.  If you wish to continue receiving Core Support Services after the 12-month period following the initial delivery of the Core Software, you must separately purchase extended Core Support Services from Synopsys for an additional fee pursuant to an accepted purchase order.  Reuse fees for Core Software do not include Core Support Services. 
5.4 The Core Software and Core Support Services are provided “AS IS”.  Synopsys disclaims all other warranties (express, implied, or statutory), including any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, or non-infringement and any warranties arising from a course of dealing or usage of trade.
6.  Term and Termination
6.1 Term of Agreement:  Both you and Synopsys must sign (either physically or through electronic acceptance) this agreement for it to take effect.  When both parties have so signed this agreement, the term of this agreement will begin on the effective date stated on the signature page and will end when all licenses granted hereunder terminate, or until this agreement terminates as provided below, whichever is sooner.
6.2 Term of Purchasing Agreement: Each Purchasing Agreement will have its own term, as indicated on that Purchasing Agreement.
6.3 Term of Individual Licenses:  The term of each license for the Core Software granted under this agreement shall begin upon the delivery date of the Core Software, and shall continue until you discontinue the sale and distribution of the applicable Licensee ICs.
6.4 Rights to Terminate:  Each party has the right to terminate this agreement, by giving written notice of termination to the other party, if (a) the other party breaches this agreement and (b) either the breach cannot be cured or, if the breach can be cured, it is not cured by the breaching party within 15 days after receiving written notice of the breach from the non-breaching party.  A substantial deviation of Core Software from the specifications in the corresponding Documentation will not be considered a breach of this agreement that allows you to terminate the agreement.
6.5 Consequences of Termination:  If and when either you or Synopsys terminates this agreement, all Purchasing Agreements in effect at that time will also terminate.  When this agreement, a Purchasing Agreement or an individual license to Core Software expires or is terminated:
(a) you must (i) immediately cease all use of the Core Software and related Confidential Information in your possession or control (or in the possession of any third party to whom you provided such materials), (ii) promptly return to Synopsys or destroy all copies of such Core Software and related Confidential Information, and (iii) within 30 days after such expiration or termination, certify in writing to Synopsys that you have complied with clauses (i) and (ii), except, however, that your license to a Core Instantiated into a Licensee IC prior to termination shall continue according to its terms;
(b) you will remain obligated to pay any amounts you owe to Synopsys at that time; and
(c) the provisions of sections 4, 5.4, 6.5, 8 and 9 will remain in effect.
7.  Third-Party Licenses and Indemnification
7.1 Indemnity:  Synopsys will, at its own expense, be entitled to defend (or at its sole option, settle) any claim asserted against you by a third party that any Core Software you obtained from Synopsys under this agreement infringes any U.S. copyright, trademark, or trade secret, or U.S. patent that issued before Synopsys’ delivery to you of the applicable Core Software.  Synopsys will indemnify you for any damages you suffer and costs you reasonably incur that are directly attributable to any such claim and that are assessed against you in a final, non-appealable judgment or agreed upon by Synopsys in a settlement.
7.2 Conditions:  Synopsys’s obligations to defend and indemnify you with respect to a particular claim are subject to the following conditions:
(a) you must promptly give Synopsys written notice of the claim;
(b) you must identify the specific Core Software at issue in the claim and indicate how the Core Software is utilized by you or your products;
(c) you must give Synopsys sole control and authority over the defense and settlement of the claim; and
(d) you must provide Synopsys with all information you have regarding the claim and cooperate with Synopsys when Synopsys defends or attempts to settle the claim.
7.3 Pro-Active Steps:  If any Core Software is, or Synopsys believes is likely to become, the subject of a claim for which Synopsys would be obligated to defend and indemnify you, then Synopsys may, at its option, do any of the following:
(a) obtain for you (at no cost to you) the right for you to continue using the Core Software as permitted by this agreement;
(b) replace or modify the Core Software to avoid the infringement problem, as long as there is no material loss of functionality; or
(c) if Synopsys reasonably concludes that it will not be feasible to do either of the above, terminate your license for the Core Software and give you a refund of the Fees you paid to Synopsys for that license.
7.4 Exclusions:  Synopsys will have no obligation to defend or indemnify you (notwithstanding the first paragraph of this section) with respect to any claim that is based on or attributable to any of the following:
(a) any modification made to the Core Software by anyone other than Synopsys;
(b) the combination or use of the Core Software with other products or materials not supplied by Synopsys or specified in the Documentation as being necessary to use the Core Software;
(c) your continued engagement in infringing activities after you were notified of the infringement or after Synopsys informed you of a modification or workaround that would have avoided the infringement;
(d) the failure to obtain a license available from a standards organization, or which would be available as a result of an undertaking to a standards organization; 
(e) the methods or processes employed in using the Core Software, other than those inherent methods and processes that are necessarily employed in the intended mode of operation of the Core Software and without which a material function of the Core Software would not operate;  
(f) compliance with your directions, instructions, specifications, or technical requirements (including any requirement that the Core Software or Licensee IC support or comply with industry or technical standards), if there are no known commercially-reasonable means of complying with such directions, instructions, specifications, or technical requirements free of a claim of infringement; or
(g) your use of the Core Software in a manner not permitted by this agreement.
7.5 Burden of Proof: You will have the burden of showing that indemnification is required pursuant to this Section 7 and that the exclusions in section 7.4 do not apply.  
7.6 No Other Obligations:  Except as expressly stated in this section 7, Synopsys has no obligation or liability to you for any actual or alleged infringement related to the Core Software.
8. Confidentiality
8.1 Confidentiality Obligations:  Each party (you and Synopsys) agrees to abide by the following confidentiality obligations with respect to the other party’s Confidential Information:
(a) do not disclose it to any third party unless (i) the other party has given its specific and express prior written approval, (ii) the disclosure is expressly allowed under this agreement, or (iii) the disclosure is necessary to comply with a valid court order or subpoena;
(b) do not use it for any reason other than to exercise its rights and perform its obligation under this agreement; and
(c) protect it from unauthorized dissemination in the same manner as that party protects its own Confidential Information, and in any event with reasonable precautions (which include limiting access to employees and contractors on a “need to know” basis).
8.2 Mandatory Disclosures:  If you believe you must disclose Synopsys’s Confidential Information in order to comply with a valid court order or subpoena, you must promptly notify Synopsys and cooperate with Synopsys if Synopsys chooses to contest the disclosure requirement, seek confidential treatment of the information to be disclosed, or to limit the nature or scope of the information to be disclosed.  Synopsys will do the same if it believes it must disclose your Confidential Information in these circumstances.
8.3 Additional Obligations: In addition to your general obligations of confidentiality regarding the Core Software and Documentation, you must monitor each End User’s use of the Core Software to ensure that the End User abides by the terms of this agreement.
9 Other Terms
9.1 Ownership of IP Rights: Synopsys and its licensors own all Intellectual Property Rights in the Core Software and Documentation.  Your only rights in the Core Software and Documentation are the rights expressly granted in this agreement; all other rights are reserved by Synopsys.  Synopsys’s licensors are third-party beneficiaries of, and thus may enforce against you the license restrictions and confidentiality obligations in this agreement with respect to their intellectual property and proprietary information. Synopsys may freely use and disseminate any Feedback you provide.  You agree not to claim that Synopsys owes you any compensation for its use or dissemination of such Feedback.
9.2 Limitation of Liability: For each product or service you license or purchase from Synopsys under this agreement, Synopsys’s total, cumulative liability to you, including under section 7, is limited to the amount of Fees you paid for that product or service (regardless of the nature of the liability or the nature or number of claims giving rise to the liability).  Synopsys will not, under any circumstances or any theory of liability, be liable to you for any lost profits, loss of data, or consequential, incidental, or special damages arising from this agreement or the products and services provided to you under this agreement.  However, this disclaimer of Synopsys’s liability for consequential damages does not limit or reduce Synopsys’s obligations to defend and indemnify you under section 7.  The limitations of liability in this section are a fundamental part of this agreement and enable Synopsys to provide products and services to you at lower prices.  These limitations of liability are intended to apply even if an exclusive remedy is found to have failed of its essential purpose.
9.3 Export Controls: You agree that the goods, software, and technology subject to this agreement are subject to the export control laws and regulations of the United States, including but not limited to the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”), and sanctions regulations of the U.S. Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Asset Controls and that you will comply with these laws and regulations.  Without limiting the foregoing, you will not, without a U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security license or license exception, (i) export, re-export, or transfer any technology, software, or source code subject to this agreement, either directly or indirectly, to any national of any country identified in Country Groups D:1 or E:1 as defined in the EARs, or (ii) export to any country identified in Country Groups D:1 or E:1 the direct product of the technology, software or source code, if such foreign produced product is subject to the national security controls as identified on the Commerce Control List (“CCL”).  In addition, goods, software and any technology subject to this agreement may not be exported, reexported, or transferred to (a) any person or entity listed on the “Entity List”, “Denied Persons List” or the list of “Specifically Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons" as such lists are maintained by the U.S. Government, or (b) an end-user engaged in activities related to weapons of mass destruction.  Such activities include but are not necessarily limited to activities related to: (1) the design, development, production, or use of nuclear materials, nuclear facilities, or nuclear weapons; (2) the design, development, production, or use of missiles or support of missiles projects; and (3) the design, development, production, or use of chemical or biological weapons.
9.4 Governing Law; Jurisdiction: This agreement is governed by the laws of the United States and the State of California, without regard to conflicts of laws principles.  The federal and state courts located in Santa Clara County, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any disputes arising from or relating to this agreement, and each party consents to such jurisdiction and venue.
9.5 Notices: Any notice, approval, consent, or other communication intended to have legal effect under this agreement must be given to the other party in writing, must be sent by first-class, registered, or overnight mail or private overnight courier (to the address for the other party stated on the signature page, unless the other party has given notice of a new address), and will be deemed given upon receipt or when delivery is refused.  A copy of any communication sent to Synopsys must also be sent to the attention of the General Counsel.
9.6 Waivers: Either party’s failure to enforce any provision of this agreement will not be deemed a waiver of the future enforcement of that provision or enforcement of any other provision.  In order to be binding, a waiver must be in writing and signed by the party giving the waiver.
9.7 Independent Contractors: The parties to this agreement are independent contractors.  Neither party is the agent or partner of the other party, or has any power or authority to act on behalf of the other party.
9.8 Severability: If any provision in this agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable as written, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect and the invalid or unenforceable provision is to be construed (and, if necessary, modified) so that it is valid and enforceable to the greatest extent possible.
9.9 Attorneys’ Fees: The prevailing party in any action to enforce this agreement will be entitled to recover costs and expenses including reasonable attorneys’ fees.
9.10 Remedies: Except where this agreement expressly provides exclusive remedies, all rights and remedies of either party (including termination rights) are cumulative. You agree that monetary damages alone would not be an adequate remedy, and therefore Synopsys will be entitled to injunctive relief if you materially breach the license restrictions or confidentiality provisions in this agreement.
9.11 Force Majeure: Each party will be excused from performance of its obligations under this agreement, except payment obligations, to the extent that performance is rendered impossible by earthquake, fire, flood, governmental action, labor disruptions, supplier failures, or any other event or circumstance beyond that party’s reasonable control.
9.12 Construction: Section headings in this agreement are for convenience only.  The word “including” (and variations thereof) is not intended to be limiting.  No rule of strict construction is to be used when interpreting this agreement. 
9.13 Counterparts: This agreement may be signed in multiple counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original and which together will constitute one instrument.
9.14 Press Release: The parties intend to work together to prepare and publish a mutually acceptable press release concerning this agreement.
9.15 Government Users: If you are a branch or agency of the United States Government, or are acquiring any Core Software on behalf of any branch or agency of the United States Government, then the following provision applies.  The Core Software and Documentation are comprised of “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation”, as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212, and are provided to the Government (i) for acquisition by or on behalf of civilian agencies, consistent with the policy set forth in 48 C.F.R. 12.212; or (ii) for acquisition by or on behalf of units of the Department of Defense, consistent with the policies set forth in 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 and 227.7202-3.

You acknowledge that: (i) Synopsys Inc. or any directly or indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary or branch of Synopsys, Inc. may treat a purchase order addressed to that entity, representative office or branch as having been addressed to the appropriate entity or entities or branch with distribution rights for the geographic region in which the Core Software will be used; and (ii) delivery will be completed by the Synopsys entity or branch with distribution rights for the geographic region in which the Core Software will be used or service will be provided.  For products used or services provided in a country in the Americas or Africa, the distributing Synopsys entity is Synopsys, Inc., based in California, USA.

9.17 Entire Agreement: This agreement and any applicable attachments, supplements and Purchasing Agreements are the entire agreement between the parties concerning its subject matter, and supersede any prior or contemporaneous agreements, communications, or understandings (whether written or oral).  However, any confidentiality or nondisclosure agreements that Synopsys previously entered into with you will remain in effect (according to their terms) with respect to the confidential information disclosed thereunder.  
9.18 Amendments: This agreement may be amended only by means of a written instrument signed by authorized representatives of both parties that specifically refers to this agreement and states the parties’ intention to amend it.  No additional or inconsistent terms on any purchase order or similar document you may submit to Synopsys will be binding on Synopsys or have any legal effect.

The text of the General Public License, version 2, a copy of which is made available below in Part Four of this document, applies to the above-listed file(s).
NOTE! This copyright does *not* cover user programs that use kernel services by normal system calls - this is merely considered normal use of the kernel, and does *not* fall under the heading of "derived work". Also note that the GPL below is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, but the instance of code that it refers to (the Linux kernel) is copyrighted by me and others who actually wrote it.
Also note that the only valid version of the GPL as far as the kernel is concerned is _this_ particular version of the license (ie v2, not v2.2 or v3.x or whatever), unless explicitly otherwise stated.

About
---
These are basic implementations of standard cryptography algorithms, written by Brad Conte (brad@bradconte.com) from scratch and without any cross-licensing. They exist to provide publically accessible, restriction-free implementations of popular cryptographic algorithms, like AES and SHA-1. These are primarily intended for educational and pragmatic purposes (such as comparing a specification to actual implementation code, or for building an internal application that computes test vectors for a product). The algorithms have been tested against standard test vectors.
 
This code is released into the public domain free of any restrictions. The author requests acknowledgement if the code is used, but does not require it. This code is provided free of any liability and without any quality claims by the author.
 
Note that these are *not* cryptographically secure implementations. They have no resistence to side-channel attacks and should not be used in contexts that need cryptographically secure implementations.
 
These algorithms are not optimized for speed or space. They are primarily designed to be easy to read, although some basic optimization techniques have been employed.
 
Building
---
The source code for each algorithm will come in a pair of a source code file and a header file. There should be no inter-header file dependencies, no additional libraries, no platform-specific header files, or any other complicating matters. Compiling them should be as easy as adding the relevent source code to the project.

xilinx_qemu for linux version 2022.1
<<<<<<<<<<xilinx-separator>>>>>>>>>>

The QEMU distribution includes both the QEMU emulator and
various firmware files.  These are separate programs that are
distributed together for our users' convenience, and they have
separate licenses.

The following points clarify the license of the QEMU emulator:

1) The QEMU emulator as a whole is released under the GNU General
Public License, version 2.

2) Parts of the QEMU emulator have specific licenses which are compatible
with the GNU General Public License, version 2. Hence each source file
contains its own licensing information.  Source files with no licensing
information are released under the GNU General Public License, version
2 or (at your option) any later version.

As of July 2013, contributions under version 2 of the GNU General Public
License (and no later version) are only accepted for the following files
or directories: bsd-user/, linux-user/, hw/vfio/, hw/xen/xen_pt*.

3) The Tiny Code Generator (TCG) is mostly under the BSD or MIT licenses;
   but some parts may be GPLv2 or other licenses. Again, see the
   specific licensing information in each source file.

4) QEMU is a trademark of Fabrice Bellard.

#+begin_quote
  OCB is covered by several patents but may be used freely by most
  software.  See http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/ocb/license.htm .
  In particular license 1 is suitable for Libgcrypt: See
  http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/ocb/license1.pdf for the full
  license document; it basically says:

    License 1 — License for Open-Source Software Implementations of OCB
                (Jan 9, 2013)

    Under this license, you are authorized to make, use, and
    distribute open-source software implementations of OCB. This
    license terminates for you if you sue someone over their
    open-source software implementation of OCB claiming that you have
    a patent covering their implementation.



 License for Open Source Software Implementations of OCB
 January 9, 2013

 1 Definitions

 1.1 “Licensor” means Phillip Rogaway.

 1.2 “Licensed Patents” means any patent that claims priority to United
 States Patent Application No. 09/918,615 entitled “Method and Apparatus
 for Facilitating Efficient Authenticated Encryption,” and any utility,
 divisional, provisional, continuation, continuations-in-part, reexamination,
 reissue, or foreign counterpart patents that may issue with respect to the
 aforesaid patent application. This includes, but is not limited to, United
 States Patent No. 7,046,802; United States Patent No. 7,200,227; United
 States Patent No. 7,949,129; United States Patent No. 8,321,675 ; and any
 patent that issues out of United States Patent Application No. 13/669,114.

 1.3 “Use” means any practice of any invention claimed in the Licensed Patents.

 1.4 “Software Implementation” means any practice of any invention
 claimed in the Licensed Patents that takes the form of software executing on
 a user-programmable, general-purpose computer or that takes the form of a
 computer-readable medium storing such software. Software Implementation does
 not include, for example, application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs),
 field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), embedded systems, or IP cores.

 1.5 “Open Source Software” means software whose source code is published
 and made available for inspection and use by anyone because either (a) the
 source code is subject to a license that permits recipients to copy, modify,
 and distribute the source code without payment of fees or royalties, or
 (b) the source code is in the public domain, including code released for
 public use through a CC0 waiver. All licenses certified by the Open Source
 Initiative at opensource.org as of January 9, 2013 and all Creative Commons
 licenses identified on the creativecommons.org website as of January 9,
 2013, including the Public License Fallback of the CC0 waiver, satisfy these
 requirements for the purposes of this license.

 1.6 “Open Source Software Implementation” means a Software
 Implementation in which the software implicating the Licensed Patents is
 Open Source Software. Open Source Software Implementation does not include
 any Software Implementation in which the software implicating the Licensed
 Patents is combined, so as to form a larger program, with software that is
 not Open Source Software.

  2 License Grant

 2.1 License. Subject to your compliance with the term s of this license,
 including the restriction set forth in Section 2.2, Licensor hereby
 grants to you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable,
 non-sublicenseable, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable license to practice
 any invention claimed in the Licensed Patents in any Open Source Software
 Implementation.

 2.2 Restriction. If you or your affiliates institute patent litigation
 (including, but not limited to, a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
 against any entity alleging that any Use authorized by this license
 infringes another patent, then any rights granted to you under this license
 automatically terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

 3 Disclaimer
 YOUR USE OF THE LICENSED PATENTS IS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND UNLESS REQUIRED
 BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
 KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED PATENTS OR ANY PRODUCT EMBODYING ANY LICENSED
 PATENT, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUT ORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
 LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY
 CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE,
 ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO ANY USE OF THE LICENSED PATENTS, INCLUDING,
 WITHOUT LIMITATION, DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
 OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
 SUCH DAMAGES PRIOR TO SUCH AN OCCURRENCE.

===> libpcre 8.45
PCRE LICENCE
------------

PCRE is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.

Release 8 of PCRE is distributed under the terms of the "BSD" licence, as
specified below. The documentation for PCRE, supplied in the "doc"
directory, is distributed under the same terms as the software itself. The data
in the testdata directory is not copyrighted and is in the public domain. 

The basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also
included in the distribution is a set of C++ wrapper functions, and a
just-in-time compiler that can be used to optimize pattern matching. These
are both optional features that can be omitted when the library is built.

xilinx_qemu for windows version 2022.1
<<<<<<<<<<xilinx-separator>>>>>>>>>>

The QEMU distribution includes both the QEMU emulator and
various firmware files.  These are separate programs that are
distributed together for our users' convenience, and they have
separate licenses.

The following points clarify the license of the QEMU emulator:

1) The QEMU emulator as a whole is released under the GNU General
Public License, version 2.

2) Parts of the QEMU emulator have specific licenses which are compatible
with the GNU General Public License, version 2. Hence each source file
contains its own licensing information.  Source files with no licensing
information are released under the GNU General Public License, version
2 or (at your option) any later version.

As of July 2013, contributions under version 2 of the GNU General Public
License (and no later version) are only accepted for the following files
or directories: bsd-user/, linux-user/, hw/vfio/, hw/xen/xen_pt*.

3) The Tiny Code Generator (TCG) is mostly under the BSD or MIT licenses;
   but some parts may be GPLv2 or other licenses. Again, see the
   specific licensing information in each source file.

4) QEMU is a trademark of Fabrice Bellard.

  OCB is covered by several patents but may be used freely by most
  software.  See http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/ocb/license.htm .
  In particular license 1 is suitable for Libgcrypt: See
  http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/ocb/license1.pdf for the full
  license document; it basically says:

    License 1 — License for Open-Source Software Implementations of OCB
                (Jan 9, 2013)

    Under this license, you are authorized to make, use, and
    distribute open-source software implementations of OCB. This
    license terminates for you if you sue someone over their
    open-source software implementation of OCB claiming that you have
    a patent covering their implementation.



 License for Open Source Software Implementations of OCB
 January 9, 2013

 1 Definitions

 1.1 “Licensor” means Phillip Rogaway.

 1.2 “Licensed Patents” means any patent that claims priority to United
 States Patent Application No. 09/918,615 entitled “Method and Apparatus
 for Facilitating Efficient Authenticated Encryption,” and any utility,
 divisional, provisional, continuation, continuations-in-part, reexamination,
 reissue, or foreign counterpart patents that may issue with respect to the
 aforesaid patent application. This includes, but is not limited to, United
 States Patent No. 7,046,802; United States Patent No. 7,200,227; United
 States Patent No. 7,949,129; United States Patent No. 8,321,675 ; and any
 patent that issues out of United States Patent Application No. 13/669,114.

 1.3 “Use” means any practice of any invention claimed in the Licensed Patents.

 1.4 “Software Implementation” means any practice of any invention
 claimed in the Licensed Patents that takes the form of software executing on
 a user-programmable, general-purpose computer or that takes the form of a
 computer-readable medium storing such software. Software Implementation does
 not include, for example, application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs),
 field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), embedded systems, or IP cores.

 1.5 “Open Source Software” means software whose source code is published
 and made available for inspection and use by anyone because either (a) the
 source code is subject to a license that permits recipients to copy, modify,
 and distribute the source code without payment of fees or royalties, or
 (b) the source code is in the public domain, including code released for
 public use through a CC0 waiver. All licenses certified by the Open Source
 Initiative at opensource.org as of January 9, 2013 and all Creative Commons
 licenses identified on the creativecommons.org website as of January 9,
 2013, including the Public License Fallback of the CC0 waiver, satisfy these
 requirements for the purposes of this license.

 1.6 “Open Source Software Implementation” means a Software
 Implementation in which the software implicating the Licensed Patents is
 Open Source Software. Open Source Software Implementation does not include
 any Software Implementation in which the software implicating the Licensed
 Patents is combined, so as to form a larger program, with software that is
 not Open Source Software.

  2 License Grant

 2.1 License. Subject to your compliance with the term s of this license,
 including the restriction set forth in Section 2.2, Licensor hereby
 grants to you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable,
 non-sublicenseable, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable license to practice
 any invention claimed in the Licensed Patents in any Open Source Software
 Implementation.

 2.2 Restriction. If you or your affiliates institute patent litigation
 (including, but not limited to, a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
 against any entity alleging that any Use authorized by this license
 infringes another patent, then any rights granted to you under this license
 automatically terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

 3 Disclaimer
 YOUR USE OF THE LICENSED PATENTS IS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND UNLESS REQUIRED
 BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY

===> libpcre 8.45
PCRE LICENCE
------------

PCRE is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.

Release 8 of PCRE is distributed under the terms of the "BSD" licence, as
specified below. The documentation for PCRE, supplied in the "doc"
directory, is distributed under the same terms as the software itself. The data
in the testdata directory is not copyrighted and is in the public domain. 

The basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also
included in the distribution is a set of C++ wrapper functions, and a
just-in-time compiler that can be used to optimize pattern matching. These
are both optional features that can be omitted when the library is built.

2. Source Code License 
2.1. The Initial Developer Grant 
 
The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims: 
 
    (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or as part of a Larger Work; and  
    (b) under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or selling of Original Code, to make, have made, use, practice, sell, and offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the Original Code (or portions thereof).  
    (c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are effective on the date Initial Developer first distributes Original Code under the terms of this License.  
    (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1 (b) above, no patent license is granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2) separate from the Original Code;  or 3) for infringements caused by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the combination of the Original Code with other software or devices.  
 
2.2. Contributor Grant 
 
Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license 
 
    (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code and/or as part of a Larger Work; and  
    (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of  Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination).  
    (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2 (a) and 2.2 (b) are effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of the Covered Code.  
    (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the Contributor Version; 2) separate from the Contributor Version; 3) for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of Contributor Version or ii) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with other software (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.  
 
3. Distribution Obligations 
3.1. Application of License 
 
The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. 
 
The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5. 
3.2. Availability of Source Code 
 
Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. 
3.3. Description of Modifications 
 
You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code. 
3.4. Intellectual Property Matters 
 
    (a) Third Party Claims 
    If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.  
    (b) Contributor APIs 
    If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.  
    (c) Representations 
    Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4 (a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.  
 
3.5. Required Notices 
 
You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. 
3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions 
 
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. 
 
The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. 
 
If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. 
3.7. Larger Works 
 
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code. 
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation 
 
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. 
5. Trademark Usage 
5.1. Advertising Materials 
 
All advertising materials mentioning features or use of the Governed Code must display the following acknowledgement: "This product includes software developed by CenterPoint - Connective Software Engineering GmbH." 
5.2. Endorsements 
 
The names "CenterPoint" and "CenterPoint - Connective Software Engineering GmbH." must not be used to endorse or promote Contributor Versions or Larger Works without the prior written permission of CenterPoint - Connective Software Engineering GmbH. 
5.3. Product Names 
 
Contributor Versions and Larger Works may not be called "CenterPoint" nor may the word "CenterPoint" appear in their names without prior written permission of CenterPoint - Connective Software Engineering GmbH. 
6. Versions of the License 
6.1. New Versions 
 
CenterPoint - Connective Software Engineering GmbH. ("CenterPoint") may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. 
6.2. Effect of New Versions 
 
Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by CenterPoint. No one other than CenterPoint has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License. 
7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY 
 
COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. 
8. TERMINATION 
 
8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. 
 
8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that: 
 
    (a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.  
    (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1 (b) and 2.2 (b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.  
 
8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license. 
 
8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination. 
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY 
 
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 
10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS 
 
The Covered Code is a "commercial item", as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation", as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein. 
11. MISCELLANEOUS 
 
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This license shall be governed by the Laws of Austria. Disputes shall be settled by an Austrian Court. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. 
12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS 
 
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

     which is covered by it's own permissive Oculus VR Rift SDK Software License.

    This code _can_ be included to produce a binding 
    and hence support for the Oculus VR Rift.

    The code is included _and_ it's build artifacts will be released,
    if the git sub-module oculusvr-sdk is included in the jogl source repository
    as true for current official JogAmp builds and releases!

    If using JogAmp JOGL builds with oculusvr-sdk support, 
    but the user prefers to _not_ use it for license or other reasons,
    the user can simply remove the artifacts 'jar/atomics/oculusvr*jar'.
    No other produced artifact is affected.

    While the Oculus VR Rift SDK Software License is permissive,
    it's differences to the New BSD license shall be mentioned, see below!

(408) 943-1234


THE ACCOMPANYING SOFTWARE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS AND
CONDITIONS OF THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT ("AGREEMENT"). PLEASE REVIEW
THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY.  ANY USE, REPRODUCTION, MODIFICATION OR
DISTRIBUTION  OF  THE  PROGRAM  CONSTITUTES  ACCEPTANCE  OF  THIS
AGREEMENT.   IF YOU ARE AGREEING TO THIS LICENSE ON BEHALF  OF  A
COMPANY,  YOU  REPRESENT  THAT  YOU  ARE  AUTHORIZED  TO BIND THE
COMPANY TO THIS AGREEMENT.

Cadence  Design  Systems,  Inc.  ("Cadence")  is  licensing   the
software  program  ("Program")  provided  hereunder under an open
source arrangement.  The licensee hereunder  may  use,  copy  and
modify  the  Program  only  pursuant  to  this  Agreement.  While
Cadence  encourages   any   and   all   improvements   or   other
modifications  made  to  the  Program  to  be  contributed to the
community source and thereby made available to others  under  the
same  terms and conditions as included in this Agreement, this is
not required.  However, any error corrections made to the Program
must be contributed to the community source.


1.      DEFINITIONS

1.1     "Contribution"  means  the  submission  of  the  Original
Program  by  Cadence  and  the  submission  of any modifications,
improvements, additions, corrections  or  other  changes  to  the
Program,  including source code, object code, application program
interface definitions and formats, and documentation, made by any
Contributor  where  such  changes and/or additions to the Program
originate  from  and   are   distributed   by   that   particular
Contributor.   Each  Contributor  acknowledges and agrees that no
guarantee is provided  that  a  Contribution  shall  be  included
within   the   Program   as  distributed  by  any  Recipient.   A
Contribution  must  be  made  by  a  Contributor  if;  (1)   such
Contribution  is  an  error correction to the Program, or (2) the
Contributor  commercially  distributes  the  Program  with   such
Contribution,  in which case the Contribution must be made within
thirty (30) days of the commercial distribution of  the  Program.
"Commercially distributes" as used herein shall mean distribution
of the Program by a  Contributor  in  consideration  for  revenue
received.   A  Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it
was added to the Program by such  Contributor  itself  or  anyone
acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include
additions to the Program  which:  (i)  are  separate  modules  of
software  or  data  distributed  in  conjunction with the Program
under their own license agreement, and (ii)  are  not  derivative
works of the Program.

1.2     "Contributor" means Cadence and  any  other  entity  that
distributes the Program.

1.3     "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable  by  any
Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of
its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

1.4     "Original Program" means  the  original  version  of  the
software  accompanying  this  Agreement  as  released by Cadence,
including source code, object code, application program interface
definitions and formats, and documentation, if any.

1.5     "Program" means the Original Program and Contributions.

1.6     "Recipient" means anyone who receives the  Program  under
this Agreement, including all Contributors.

2.      GRANT OF RIGHTS

2.1     Subject to the terms and conditions  of  this  Agreement,
each  Contributor  hereby  grants each Recipient a non-exclusive,
worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to  reproduce,  prepare
derivative   works   of,   publicly  display,  publicly  perform,
distribute and sublicense the Contribution of  such  Contributor,
in source code and object code format.

2.2     Subject to the terms and conditions  of  this  Agreement,
each  Contributor  hereby  grants each Recipient a non-exclusive,
worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents  to
make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the
Contribution of such Contributor, if  any,  in  source  code  and
object  code  format  along  with  any documentation. This patent
license shall apply to the combination of  the  Contribution  and
the  Program  if,  at  the  time the Contribution is added by the
Contributor,  such  addition  of  the  Contribution  causes  such
combination  to  be  covered  by the Licensed Patents. The patent
license shall not apply to any other combinations  which  include
the Contribution.

2.3     Subject to the terms and conditions  of  this  Agreement,
Cadence  hereby grants each Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
royalty-free trademark license, to  use  the  Cadence  trademarks
"LEF",  or  "DEF", in accordance with Cadence’s marking policies,
in connection with the license grants hereunder.

2.4     Recipient  understands  that  although  each  Contributor
grants  the  licenses  to  its Contributions set forth herein, no
assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program  does
not  infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of
any other entity. Each Contributor  disclaims  any  liability  to
Recipient  for  claims  brought  by  any  other  entity  based on
infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise.  As  a
condition   to   exercising   the  rights  and  licenses  granted
hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole  responsibility  to
secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For
example, if a third party patent license  is  required  to  allow
Recipient   to   distribute   the   Program,  it  is  Recipient's
responsibility to acquire that license  before  distributing  the
Program.

2.5     Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it  has
sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
the copyright license set forth in  this  Agreement.   Except  as
expressly  stated  in  Sections 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 above, Recipient
receives no rights or licenses to the  intellectual  property  of
any  Contributor  under  this  Agreement,  whether  expressly, by
implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not
expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.


3.      DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS

3.1     A Contributor may choose to  distribute  the  Program  in
object  code form under its own license agreement, provided that:
(a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this  Agreement;
and   (b)  the terms and conditions of its license agreement: (i)
effectively  disclaims  on  behalf  of   all   Contributors   all
warranties   and   conditions,  express  and  implied,  including
warranties or  conditions  of  title  and  non-infringement,  and
implied  warranties  or conditions of merchantability and fitness
for a particular purpose;

(ii) effectively excludes  on  behalf  of  all  Contributors  all
liability  for  damages,  including,  but not limited to, direct,
indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages;

(iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement
are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party;
and

(iv) states that source code for the Program  is  available  from
such  Contributor,  and  informs  licensees how to obtain it in a
reasonable manner on or through a  medium  customarily  used  for
software exchange.

3.2     When the Program is made available in source code form it
must  be  made  available  under the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.  A copy of this Agreement must be included  with  each
copy  of  such  Program.   A Contributor may not charge a fee for
the distribution of the source code of the Program.

3.3     Each Contributor must preserve all  copyright  and  other
notices   that   appear   in  the  Program.   In  addition,  each
Contributor  must  identify  itself  as  the  originator  of  its
Contribution,   if  any,  in  a  manner  that  reasonably  allows
subsequent  Recipients  to  identify  the   originator   of   the
Contribution.

3.4     While  this  license  is  intended  to   facilitate   the
commercial  use  of the Program, the Contributor who includes the
Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.
Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a  commercial
product  offering,  such  Contributor  ("Commercial Contributor")
hereby agrees to defend and  indemnify  every  other  Contributor
("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs
(collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits  and  other
legal  actions  brought  by a third party against the Indemnified
Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the
Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this
section  do  not  apply  to  any claims or Losses relating to any
actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to
qualify,  an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the
Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the
Commercial   Contributor  to  control,  and  cooperate  with  the
Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
negotiations.  The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any
such claim at its own expense.


4.      NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE  PROGRAM  IS
PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
ANY  KIND,  EITHER  EXPRESS   OR   IMPLIED   INCLUDING,   WITHOUT
LIMITATION,   ANY   WARRANTIES   OR  CONDITIONS  OF  TITLE,  NON-
INFRINGEMENT,  MERCHANTABILITY  OR  FITNESS  FOR   A   PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes
all  risks  associated  with  its  exercise  of rights under this
Agreement, including but not limited to the risks  and  costs  of
program  errors,  compliance  with  applicable laws, damage to or
loss of  data,  programs  or  equipment,  and  unavailability  or
interruption of operations.

5.      DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT  AS  EXPRESSLY  SET  FORTH  IN  THIS  AGREEMENT,   NEITHER
RECIPIENT  NOR  ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY
DIRECT,   INDIRECT,   INCIDENTAL,    SPECIAL,    EXEMPLARY,    OR
CONSEQUENTIAL   DAMAGES   (INCLUDING   WITHOUT   LIMITATION  LOST
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY,  WHETHER
IN  CONTRACT,  STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR  DISTRIBUTION  OF
THE  PROGRAM  OR   THE  EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER,
EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

6.      GENERAL

6.1     If  any  provision  of  this  Agreement  is  invalid   or
unenforceable  under  applicable  law,  it  shall  not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of  this
Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
provision shall be reformed to the minimum  extent  necessary  to
make such provision valid and enforceable.

6.2     If  Recipient  institutes  patent  litigation  against  a
Contributor  with  respect  to  a  patent  applicable to software
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then  any
patent  licenses  granted  by  that Contributor to such Recipient
under  this  Agreement  shall  terminate  as  of  the  date  such
litigation  is  filed.  If Recipient institutes patent litigation
against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in  a
lawsuit) alleging that the Program (excluding combinations of the
Program  with  other  software  or   hardware)   infringes   such
Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under
Section 2.2 shall terminate as of the  date  such  litigation  is
filed.

6.3     If a  Commercial  Contributor  distributes  any  Program,
which  includes  such  Contributors  modifications, improvements,
additions, corrections or other  changes,  and  has  not  made  a
Contribution  of  such  Program,  any  licenses  granted  to such
Commercial Contributor under this Agreement shall terminate as of
the date of such Program is distributed.

6.4     All  Recipient's  rights  under  this   Agreement   shall
terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or
conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in  a
reasonable   period   of   time  after  becoming  aware  of  such
noncompliance. If all Recipient's  rights  under  this  Agreement
terminate,  Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the
Program as soon as reasonably practicable.  However,  Recipient's
obligations  under  this  Agreement  and  any licenses granted by
Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

6.5     Cadence may publish new versions (including revisions) of
this  Agreement  from  time  to  time.  Each  new  version of the
Agreement will be given  a  distinguishing  version  number.  The
Program  (including  Contributions)  may  always  be  distributed
subject to the version  of  the  Agreement  under  which  it  was
received.  In  addition,  after a new version of the Agreement is
published,  Contributor  may  elect  to  distribute  the  Program
(including its Contributions) under the new version. No one other
than Cadence has the right to modify this Agreement.

6.6     This Agreement is governed by the laws of  the  State  of
California  and  the  intellectual  property  laws  of the United
States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a  legal
action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of
action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any
resulting litigation.

dtc version 1.5.0
<<<<<<<<<<xilinx-separator>>>>>>>>>>


Licensing and contribution policy of dtc and libfdt
===================================================

This dtc package contains two pieces of software: dtc itself, and
libfdt which comprises the files in the libfdt/ subdirectory.  These
two pieces of software, although closely related, are quite distinct.
dtc does not incoporate or rely on libfdt for its operation, nor vice
versa.  It is important that these two pieces of software have
different license conditions.

As the copyright banners in each source file attest, dtc is licensed
under the GNU GPL.  The full text of the GPL can be found in the file
entitled 'GPL' which should be included in this package.  dtc code,
therefore, may not be incorporated into works which do not have a GPL
compatible license.

libfdt, however, is GPL/BSD dual-licensed.  That is, it may be used
either under the terms of the GPL, or under the terms of the 2-clause
BSD license (aka the ISC license).  The full terms of that license are
given in the copyright banners of each of the libfdt source files.
This is, in practice, equivalent to being BSD licensed, since the
terms of the BSD license are strictly more permissive than the GPL.

I made the decision to license libfdt in this way because I want to
encourage widespread and correct usage of flattened device trees,
including by proprietary or otherwise GPL-incompatible firmware or
tools.  Allowing libfdt to be used under the terms of the BSD license
makes that it easier for vendors or authors of such software to do so.

This does mean that libfdt code could be "stolen" - say, included in a
proprietary fimware and extended without contributing those extensions
back to the libfdt mainline.  While I hope that doesn't happen, I
believe the goal of allowing libfdt to be widely used is more
important than avoiding that.  libfdt is quite small, and hardly
rocket science; so the incentive for such impolite behaviour is small,
and the inconvenience caused therby is not dire.

Licenses such as the LGPL which would allow code to be used in non-GPL
software, but also require contributions to be returned were
considered.  However, libfdt is designed to be used in firmwares and
other environments with unusual technical constraints.  It's difficult
to anticipate all possible changes which might be needed to meld
libfdt into such environments and so difficult to suitably word a
license that puts the boundary between what is and isn't permitted in
the intended place.  Again, I judged encouraging widespread use of
libfdt by keeping the license terms simple and familiar to be the more
important goal.

**IMPORTANT** It's intended that all of libfdt as released remain
permissively licensed this way.  Therefore only contributions which
are released under these terms can be merged into the libfdt mainline.

<<<<<<<<<<xilinx-separator>>>>>>>>>>

Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS
"Contribution" means:

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content Distributed under this Agreement, and
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
i) changes to the Program, and
ii) additions to the Program;
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that are not Modified Works.
"Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.

"Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified Works shall not include works that contain only declarations, interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program or Modified Works thereof.

"Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.

"Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making modifications, including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.

"Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License, Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial Contributor.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
3. REQUIREMENTS
3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:

a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange; and
b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements of this section 3.
3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability (`notices') contained within the Program from any copy of the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add their own appropriate notices.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version.

Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient. No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.

Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
"This Source Code may also be made available under the following Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s), version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."

Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.

If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.

You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.

b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.

d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

b) its license agreement:

i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

When the Program is made available in source code form:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version.

Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient. No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.

Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
"This Source Code may also be made available under the following Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s), version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."

Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.

If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.

You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

Eclipse Public License - v 2.0

    THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
    PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
    OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

  a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
     Distributed under this Agreement, and

  b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
     i) changes to the Program, and
     ii) additions to the Program;
  where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
  and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
  "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
  such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
  Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
  are not Modified Works.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
or when combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.

"Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
or Modified Works thereof.

"Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.

"Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
documentation source, and configuration files.

"Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
Contributor.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
  grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
  license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
  publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
  Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.

  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
  grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
  license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
  import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
  if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
  apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
  the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
  of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
  Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
  combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
  licensed hereunder.

  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
  licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
  provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
  patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
  Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
  brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
  property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
  rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
  assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
  property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
  patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
  Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
  before distributing the Program.

  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
  sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
  the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

  e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
  Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
  those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
  receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
  (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).

3. REQUIREMENTS

3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:

  a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
  accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
  the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
  is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
  obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
  used for software exchange; and

  b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
  different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
     i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
     warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
     warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
     implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
     for a particular purpose;

     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
     liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
     incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;

     iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
     in the Source Code under section 3.2; and

     iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
     party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
     of this section 3.

3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:

  a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
  Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
  files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
  Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
  Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
  under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and

  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
  the Program.

3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
their own appropriate notices.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
participate in any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
Contributions) under the new version.

Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.

Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice

"This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."

  Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
  is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.

  If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
  file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
  file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
  look for such a notice.

  You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

LEGAL ISSUES
============

In plain English:

1. We don't promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs,
   please let us know!)
2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay us.
3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a
   program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that
   you've used the IJG code.

In legalese:

The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,
with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or
fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you,
its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.

This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane.
All Rights Reserved except as specified below.

Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
conditions:
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
the Independent JPEG Group".
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
acknowledge us.

Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's
software".

We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of
commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
assumed by the product vendor.


ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file
ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
the foregoing paragraphs do.

The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright
by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.

It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by
patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot
legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason,
support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.
(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented
Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)
So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining
code.

The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has
been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
"uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
GIF decoders.

We are required to state that
    "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
    CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
    CompuServe Incorporated."

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
3. REQUIREMENTS
3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:

a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange; and
b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;

iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements of this section 3.
3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability (`notices') contained within the Program from any copy of the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add their own appropriate notices.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version.

Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient. No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.

Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
"This Source Code may also be made available under the following Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s), version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."

Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.

Eclipse Public License - v 1.0
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and

b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

i) changes to the Program, and

ii) additions to the Program;

where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.

b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.

d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

b) its license agreement:

i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;

iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward.

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ANY APPLICABLE LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR NOTICES INDICATED OR REFERENCED BELOW, THEN YOU MAY NOT USE THE CONTENT.

Applicable Licenses
Unless otherwise indicated, all Content made available by the Eclipse Foundation is provided to you under the terms and conditions of the Eclipse Public License Version 1.0 ("EPL"). A copy of the EPL is provided with this Content and is also available at http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html. For purposes of the EPL, "Program" will mean the Content.

Content includes, but is not limited to, source code, object code, documentation and other files maintained in the Eclipse Foundation source code repository ("Repository") in software modules ("Modules") and made available as downloadable archives ("Downloads").

Content may be structured and packaged into modules to facilitate delivering, extending, and upgrading the Content. Typical modules may include plug-ins ("Plug-ins"), plug-in fragments ("Fragments"), and features ("Features").
Each Plug-in or Fragment may be packaged as a sub-directory or JAR (Java© ARchive) in a directory named "plugins".
A Feature is a bundle of one or more Plug-ins and/or Fragments and associated material. Each Feature may be packaged as a sub-directory in a directory named "features". Within a Feature, files named "feature.xml" may contain a list of the names and version numbers of the Plug-ins and/or Fragments associated with that Feature.
Features may also include other Features ("Included Features"). Within a Feature, files named "feature.xml" may contain a list of the names and version numbers of Included Features.
The terms and conditions governing Plug-ins and Fragments should be contained in files named "about.html" ("Abouts"). The terms and conditions governing Features and Included Features should be contained in files named "license.html" ("Feature Licenses"). Abouts and Feature Licenses may be located in any directory of a Download or Module including, but not limited to the following locations:

The top-level (root) directory
Plug-in and Fragment directories
Inside Plug-ins and Fragments packaged as JARs
Sub-directories of the directory named "src" of certain Plug-ins
Feature directories
Note: if a Feature made available by the Eclipse Foundation is installed using the Provisioning Technology (as defined below), you must agree to a license ("Feature Update License") during the installation process. If the Feature contains Included Features, the Feature Update License should either provide you with the terms and conditions governing the Included Features or inform you where you can locate them. Feature Update Licenses may be found in the "license" property of files named "feature.properties" found within a Feature.

eclipse-emf version 2.14.0
<<<<<<<<<<xilinx-separator>>>>>>>>>>

Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS
"Contribution" means:

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content Distributed under this Agreement, and
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
i) changes to the Program, and
ii) additions to the Program;
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that are not Modified Works.
"Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.

"Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified Works shall not include works that contain only declarations, interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program or Modified Works thereof.

"Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.

"Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making modifications, including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.

"Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License, Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial Contributor.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
3. REQUIREMENTS
3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:

a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange; and
b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements of this section 3.
3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability (`notices') contained within the Program from any copy of the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add their own appropriate notices.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version.

Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient. No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.

Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
"This Source Code may also be made available under the following Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s), version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."

Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.

If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.

You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

  b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
  different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
     i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
     warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
     warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
     implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
     for a particular purpose;

     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
     liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
     incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;

     iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
     in the Source Code under section 3.2; and

     iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
     party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
     of this section 3.

3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:

  a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
  Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
  files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
  Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
  Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
  under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and

  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
  the Program.

3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
their own appropriate notices.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
participate in any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
Contributions) under the new version.

Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.

Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice

"This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."

  Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
  is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.

  If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
  file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
  file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
  look for such a notice.

  You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

Eclipse Public License - v 2.0

    THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
    PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
    OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

  a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
     Distributed under this Agreement, and

  b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
     i) changes to the Program, and
     ii) additions to the Program;
  where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
  and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
  "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
  such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
  Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
  are not Modified Works.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
or when combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.

"Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
or Modified Works thereof.

"Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.

"Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
documentation source, and configuration files.

"Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
Contributor.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
  grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
  license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
  publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
  Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.

  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
  grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
  license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
  import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
  if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
  apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
  the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
  of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
  Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
  combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
  licensed hereunder.

  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
  licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
  provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
  patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
  Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
  brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
  property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
  rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
  assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
  property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
  patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
  Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
  before distributing the Program.

  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
  sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
  the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

  e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
  Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
  those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
  receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
  (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).

3. REQUIREMENTS

3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:

  a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
  accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
  the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
  is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
  obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
  used for software exchange; and

  b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
  different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
     i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
     warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
     warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
     implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
     for a particular purpose;

     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
     liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
     incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;

     iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
     in the Source Code under section 3.2; and

     iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
     party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
     of this section 3.

3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:

  a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
  Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
  files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
  Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
  Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
  under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and

  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
  the Program.

3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
their own appropriate notices.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
participate in any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
Contributions) under the new version.

Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.

"This Source Code may also be made available under the following
Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth
in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."

  Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
  is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.

  If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
  file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
  file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
  look for such a notice.

      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,

<<<<<<<<<<xilinx-separator>>>>>>>>>>

Eclipse Public License - v 1.0

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
i) changes to the Program, and
ii) additions to the Program;
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
b) its license agreement:
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
When the Program is made available in source code form:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created
using the Font Software.

TERMINATION
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.

DISCLAIMER
THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT
OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE

INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING

Eclipse Public License - v 2.0

    THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
    PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
    OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

  a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
     Distributed under this Agreement, and

  b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
     i) changes to the Program, and
     ii) additions to the Program;
  where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
  and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
  "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
  such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
  Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
  are not Modified Works.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
or when combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.

"Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
or Modified Works thereof.

"Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.

"Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
documentation source, and configuration files.

"Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
Contributor.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
  grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
  license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
  publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
  Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.

  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
  grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
  license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
  import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
  if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
  apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
  the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
  of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
  Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
  combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
  licensed hereunder.

  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
  licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
  provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
  patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
  Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
  brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
  property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
  rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
  assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
  property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
  patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
  Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
  before distributing the Program.

  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
  sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
  the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

  e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
  Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
  those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
  receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
  (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).

3. REQUIREMENTS

3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:

  a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
  accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
  the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
  is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
  obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
  used for software exchange; and

  b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
  different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
     i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
     warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
     warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
     implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
     for a particular purpose;

     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
     liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
     incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;

     iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
     in the Source Code under section 3.2; and

     iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
     party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
     of this section 3.

3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:

  a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
  Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
  files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
  Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
  Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
  under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and

  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
  the Program.

3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
their own appropriate notices.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
participate in any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
Contributions) under the new version.

Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.

Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice

"This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."

  Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
  is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.

  If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
  file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
  file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
  look for such a notice.

  You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

## Cryptography

Content may contain encryption software. The country in which you are currently
may have restrictions on the import, possession, and use, and/or re-export to
another country, of encryption software. BEFORE using any encryption software,
please check the country's laws, regulations and policies concerning the import,
possession, or use, and re-export of encryption software, to see if this is
permitted.

## Electron

NOTICE:

Please note Electron combines Chromium and Node.js into a single runtime.
While Electron, Chromium and Node.js are generally licensed under very
permissive MIT and BSD-3-Clause licenses, both Electron and Chromium distribute
FFmpeg.  While FFmpeg is under the LGPL-2.1-or-later license it incorporates
several optional parts and optimizations that are covered by the
GPL-2.0-or-later.  We understand both Electron and Chromium do not distribute
versions of FFmpeg with GPL content enabled; however, FFmpeg may be configured
enabled to work with proprietary codecs.  It is our understanding these
proprietary codecs may be patented; and as a result, may be subject to
licensing fees.

We strongly recommend downstream consumers verify the type of FFmpeg support
configured and modify as required.  More information on instructions to verify
can be found here
https://electronjs.org/docs/development/upgrading-chromium#verify-ffmpeg-support

eclipse-wtp version 3.8.2
<<<<<<<<<<xilinx-separator>>>>>>>>>>

Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS
"Contribution" means:

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content Distributed under this Agreement, and
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
i) changes to the Program, and
ii) additions to the Program;
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that are not Modified Works.
"Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.

"Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified Works shall not include works that contain only declarations, interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program or Modified Works thereof.

"Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.

"Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making modifications, including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.

"Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License, Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial Contributor.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
3. REQUIREMENTS
3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:

a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange; and
b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements of this section 3.
3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability (`notices') contained within the Program from any copy of the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add their own appropriate notices.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version.

Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient. No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.

Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
"This Source Code may also be made available under the following Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s), version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."

Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.

If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.

You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

     Regular expression support is provided by the PCRE library package,
     which is open source software, written by Philip Hazel, and copyright
     by the University of Cambridge, England.

   somewhere reasonably visible in your documentation and in any relevant

   intended to apply to whole chains of software. If package A includes PCRE,
   it must acknowledge it, but if package B is software that includes package
   A, the condition is not imposed on package B (unless it uses PCRE

ansi2knr is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY
WARRANTY. No author or distributor accepts responsibility to anyone for the
consequences of using it or for whether it serves any particular purpose or
works at all, unless he says so in writing. Refer to the GNU General Public
License (the "GPL") for full details.

Everyone is granted permission to copy, modify and redistribute ansi2knr,
but only under the conditions described in the GPL. A copy of this license
is supposed to have been given to you along with ansi2knr so you can know
your rights and responsibilities. It should be in a file named COPYLEFT,
or, if there is no file named COPYLEFT, a file named COPYING. Among other
things, the copyright notice and this notice must be preserved on all
copies.

We explicitly state here what we believe is already implied by the GPL: if
the ansi2knr program is distributed as a separate set of sources and a
separate executable file which are aggregated on a storage medium together
with another program, this in itself does not bring the other program under
the GPL, nor does the mere fact that such a program or the procedures for
constructing it invoke the ansi2knr executable bring any other part of the
program under the GPL.

 The mascot and logo were designed by

 Glenda <http://plan9.bell-labs.com/plan9/glenda.html>,
 the Plan 9 bunny.
 The gopher is derived from one she used for an WFMU <http://wfmu.org/>
 T-shirt design some years ago.

License: CC-BY-3.0
 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
 CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS
 PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE
 WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS
 PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND
 AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS
 LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU
 THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions
 .
   a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work
      and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,
      derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
      literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and
      includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which
      the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any
      form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work
      that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an
      Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of
      doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or
      phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation
      with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an
      Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
 .
   b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works,
      such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances,
      phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other
      than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the
      selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute
      intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its
      entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other
      contributions, each constituting separate and independent works
      in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective
      whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
      considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of
      this License.
 .
   c. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original
      and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through
      sale or other transfer of ownership.
 .
   d. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities
      that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
 .
   e. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic
      work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who
      created the Work or if no individual or entity can be
      identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a
      performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other
      persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or
      otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of
      folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the
      person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a
      performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of
      broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.
 .
   f. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the
      terms of this License including without limitation any
      production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain,
      whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including
      digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a
      lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a
      dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or
      entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or
      without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated
      works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work
      of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or
      lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works
      expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of
      applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or
      three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography,
      architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a
      phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected
      as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or
      circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a
      literary or artistic work.
 .
   g. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
      License who has not previously violated the terms of this
      License with respect to the Work, or who has received express
      permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this
      License despite a previous violation.
 .
   h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the
      Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations,
      by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or
      public digital performances; to make available to the public
      Works in such a way that members of the public may access these
      Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them;
      to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and
      the communication to the public of the performances of the Work,
      including by public digital performance; to broadcast and
      rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or
      images.
 .
   i. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means
      including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and
      the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work,
      including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in
      digital form or other electronic medium.
 .
 2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to
 reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights
 arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in
 connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other
 applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
 exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
   a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
      Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
      Collections;
 .
   b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
      Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes
      reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise
      identify that changes were made to the original Work. For
      example, a translation could be marked "The original work was
      translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could
      indicate "The original work has been modified.";
 .
   c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as
      incorporated in Collections; and,
 .
   d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
 .
   e. For the avoidance of doubt:
 .
	i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those
	   jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties
	   through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot
	   be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to
	   collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the
           rights granted under this License;
 .
       ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions
	   in which the right to collect royalties through any
	   statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the
	   Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such
	   royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
           under this License; and,
 .
      iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to
	   collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event
	   that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
	   administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society,
	   from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this
           License.
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether
 now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to
 make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the
 rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all
 rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
 made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
   a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the
      terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the
      Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every
      copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not
      offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of
      this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to
      exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
      the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
      intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
      disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
      Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
      Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
      measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of
      the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that
      recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)
      applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this
      does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be
      made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
      Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
      extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as
      required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an
      Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
      extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as
      required by Section 4(b), as requested.
 .
   b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any
      Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been
      made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices
      for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You
      are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or
      pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original
      Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g.,
      a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution
      ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of
      service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or
      parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the
      extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
      specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does
      not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for
      the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case
      of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in
      the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
      Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by
      Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may
      be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that
      in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such
      credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of
      the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these
      credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for
      the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You
      may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose
      of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising
      Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or
      explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or
      endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
      Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without
      the separate, express prior written permission of the Original
      Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
 .
   c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may
      be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce,
      Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as
      part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort,
      mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to
      the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's
      honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions
      (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in
      Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations)
      would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or
      other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's
      honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as
      appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by
      the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably
      exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to
      make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,
 LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
 WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
 STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
 TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
 NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
 OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
 SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES,
 SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY
 APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY
 LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
 EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,
 EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
   a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
      automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this
      License.  Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations
      or Collections from You under this License, however, will not
      have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
      entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.
      Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of
      this License.
 .
   b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted
      here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright
      in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the
      right to release the Work under different license terms or to
      stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that
      any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or
      any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
      under the terms of this License), and this License will continue
      in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
   a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
      Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
      the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted
      to You under this License.
 .
   b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation,
      Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work
      on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
      under this License.
 .
   c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable
      under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or
      enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License,
      and without further action by the parties to this agreement,
      such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary
      to make such provision valid and enforceable.
 .
   d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and
      no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
      writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver
      or consent.
 .
   e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the
      parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no
      understandings, agreements or representations with respect to
      the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any
      additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
      You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written
      agreement of the Licensor and You.
 .
   f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in
      this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne
      Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as
      amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the
      WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and
      Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention
      (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter
      take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License
      terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding
      provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in
      the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights
      granted under applicable copyright law includes additional
      rights not granted under this License, such additional rights
      are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not
      intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate

## About the IPython Development Team

The IPython Development Team is the set of all contributors to the IPython project.
This includes all of the IPython subprojects.

The core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here:
https://github.com/jupyter/.

## Our Copyright Policy

IPython uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright
over their contributions to IPython. But, it is important to note that these
contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the IPython
source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or
institution.  Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire IPython
Development Team.  If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what
changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate
their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the
change to one of the IPython repositories.

With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file
to indicate the copyright and license terms:

 SAX is free!

 In fact, it's not possible to own a license to SAX, since it's been placed in
 the public domain.

 No Warranty

 Because SAX is released to the public domain, there is no warranty for the
 design or for the software implementation, to the extent permitted by
 applicable law. Except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders
 and/or other parties provide SAX "as is" without warranty of any kind, either
 expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties
 of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as
 to the quality and performance of SAX is with you. Should SAX prove
 defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or
 correction.

 In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will
 any copyright holder, or any other party who may modify and/or redistribute
 SAX, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental
 or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use SAX
 (including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate
 or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the SAX to
 operate with any other programs), even if such holder or other party has been
 advised of the possibility of such damages.

ABSTRACT
========

   UPX and UCL are copyrighted software distributed under the terms
   of the GNU General Public License (hereinafter the "GPL").

   The stub which is imbedded in each UPX compressed program is part
   of UPX and UCL, and contains code that is under our copyright. The
   terms of the GNU General Public License still apply as compressing
   a program is a special form of linking with our stub.

   As a special exception we grant the free usage of UPX for all
   executables, including commercial programs.
   See below for details and restrictions.


COPYRIGHT
=========

   UPX and UCL are copyrighted software. All rights remain with the authors.

   UPX is Copyright (C) 1996-2000 Markus Franz Xaver Johannes Oberhumer

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
==========================

   UPX and the UCL library are free software; you can redistribute them
   and/or modify them under the terms of the GNU General Public License as
   published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of
   the License, or (at your option) any later version.

   UPX and UCL are distributed in the hope that they will be useful,
   but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
   MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
   GNU General Public License for more details.

   You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
   along with this program; see the file COPYING.


SPECIAL EXCEPTION FOR COMPRESSED EXECUTABLES
============================================

   The stub which is imbedded in each UPX compressed program is part
   of UPX and UCL, and contains code that is under our copyright. The
   terms of the GNU General Public License still apply as compressing
   a program is a special form of linking with our stub.

   Hereby Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer and Laszlo Molnar grant you special
   permission to freely use and distribute all UPX compressed programs
   (including commercial ones), subject to the following restrictions:

   1. You must compress your program with a completely unmodified UPX
      version; either with our precompiled version, or (at your option)
      with a self compiled version of the unmodified UPX sources as
      distributed by us.
   2. This also implies that the UPX stub must be completely unmodfied, i.e.
      the stub imbedded in your compressed program must be byte-identical
      to the stub that is produced by the official unmodified UPX version.
   3. The decompressor and any other code from the stub must exclusively get
      used by the unmodified UPX stub for decompressing your program at
      program startup. No portion of the stub may get read, copied,
      called or otherwise get used or accessed by your program.


ANNOTATIONS
===========

  - You can use a modified UPX version or modified UPX stub only for
    programs that are compatible with the GNU General Public License.

  - We grant you special permission to freely use and distribute all UPX
    compressed programs. But any modification of the UPX stub (such as,
    but not limited to, removing our copyright string or making your
    program non-decompressible) will immediately revoke your right to
    use and distribute a UPX compressed program.

  - UPX is not a software protection tool; by requiring that you use
    the unmodified UPX version for your proprietary programs we
    make sure that any user can decompress your program. This protects
    both you and your users as nobody can hide malicious code -
    any program that cannot be decompressed is highly suspicious
    by definition.

  - You can integrate all or part of UPX and UCL into projects that
    are compatible with the GNU GPL, but obviously you cannot grant
    any special exceptions beyond the GPL for our code in your project.

  - We want to actively support manufacturers of virus scanners and
    similar security software. Please contact us if you would like to
    incorporate parts of UPX or UCL into such a product.

which may contain terms different from this License, provided that (i)
Recipient is in compliance with the terms of this License, and (ii) the
license terms include this Section 2 and Sections 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 12 and 13 of
this License, which terms may not be modified or superseded by any other terms
of such license. If Recipient distributes the source code version under a
different license Recipient must make it absolutely clear that any terms which
differ from this License are offered by Recipient alone, not by SGI. Recipient
hereby agrees to indemnify SGI for any liability incurred by SGI as a result
of any such terms Recipient offers.

3. Redistribution in Executable Form. The notice set forth in Exhibit A must
be conspicuously included in any notice in an executable version of Subject
Software, related documentation or collateral in which Recipient describes the
user's rights relating to the Subject Software. Recipient may distribute the
executable version of Subject Software under a license of Recipient's choice,

Recipient is in compliance with the terms of this License, and (ii) the
license terms include this Section 3 and Sections 4, 7, 8, 10, 12 and 13 of

hereby agrees to indemnify SGI for any liability incurred by SGI as a result
of any such terms Recipient offers.

4. Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically if Recipient fails to comply with terms herein and fails to cure
such breach within 30 days of the breach. Any sublicense to the Subject
Software which is properly granted shall survive any termination of this
License absent termination by the terms of such sublicense. Provisions which,
by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
shall survive.

5. No Trademark Rights. This License does not grant any rights to use any
trade name, trademark or service mark whatsoever. No trade name, trademark or
service mark of SGI may be used to endorse or promote products derived from
the Subject Software without prior written permission of SGI.

6. No Other Rights. This License does not grant any rights with respect to the
OpenGL API or to any software or hardware implementation thereof or to any
other software whatsoever, nor shall any other rights or licenses not
expressly granted hereunder arise by implication, estoppel or otherwise with
respect to the Subject Software. Title to and ownership of the Original
Software at all times remains with SGI. All rights in the Original Software
not expressly granted under this License are reserved.

applicable laws and regulations in connection with use and distribution of the
Subject Software, including but not limited to, all export and import control
laws and regulations of the U.S. government and other countries. Recipient may
not distribute Subject Software that (i) in any way infringes (directly or
contributorily) the rights (including patent, copyright, trade secret,
trademark or other intellectual property rights of any kind) of any other
person or entity or (ii) breaches any representation or warranty, express,
implied or statutory, which under any applicable law it might be deemed to
have been distributed.

8. Claims of Infringement. If Recipient at any time has knowledge of any one
or more third party claims that reproduction, modification, use, distribution,
import or sale of Subject Software (including particular functionality or code
incorporated in Subject Software) infringes the third party's intellectual
property rights, Recipient must place in a well-identified web page bearing
the title "LEGAL" a description of each such claim and a description of the
party making each such claim in sufficient detail that a user of the Subject
Software will know whom to contact regarding the claim. Also, upon gaining
such knowledge of any such claim, Recipient must conspicuously include the URL
for such web page in the Exhibit A notice required under Sections 2 and 3,
above, and in the text of any related documentation, license agreement or
collateral in which Recipient describes end user's rights relating to the

steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably
calculated to inform those who received the Subject Software that new
knowledge has been obtained.

9. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. SUBJECT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON- INFRINGING. SGI ASSUMES NO

WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY),
CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL SGI OR ANY SGI LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY
DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK
STOPPAGE, LOSS OF DATA, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY
TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SGI's NEGLIGENCE TO
THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT
ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO RECIPIENT.

11. Indemnity. Recipient shall be solely responsible for damages arising,
directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License.
Recipient will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Silicon Graphics, Inc. from
and against any loss, liability, damages, costs or expenses (including the

possible the same economic effect as the original provision and the remainder
of this License will remain in effect. This License shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the United States and the State of
California as applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely

                 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT LICENSING

Certain files distributed by Oracle America, Inc. and/or its affiliates are 
subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPLv2, 
based on the GNU Project exception for its Classpath libraries, known as the 
GNU Classpath Exception.

Note that Oracle includes multiple, independent programs in this software 
package.  Some of those programs are provided under licenses deemed 
incompatible with the GPLv2 by the Free Software Foundation and others. 
For example, the package includes programs licensed under the Apache 
License, Version 2.0 and may include FreeType. Such programs are licensed 
to you under their original licenses. 

Oracle facilitates your further distribution of this package by adding the 
Classpath Exception to the necessary parts of its GPLv2 code, which permits 
you to use that code in combination with other independent modules not 
licensed under the GPLv2. However, note that this would not permit you to 
commingle code under an incompatible license with Oracle's GPLv2 licensed 
code by, for example, cutting and pasting such code into a file also 
containing Oracle's GPLv2 licensed code and then distributing the result. 

Additionally, if you were to remove the Classpath Exception from any of the 
files to which it applies and distribute the result, you would likely be 
required to license some or all of the other code in that distribution under 
the GPLv2 as well, and since the GPLv2 is incompatible with the license terms 
of some items included in the distribution by Oracle, removing the Classpath 
Exception could therefore effectively compromise your ability to further 
distribute the package. 

Failing to distribute notices associated with some files may also create 
unexpected legal consequences.
 
Proceed with caution and we recommend that you obtain the advice of a lawyer 
skilled in open source matters before removing the Classpath Exception or 
making modifications to this package which may subsequently be redistributed 
and/or involve the use of third party software.

JIDE Software, Inc.
Copyright (c) 2002 - 2017 JIDE Software, Inc, all rights reserved.

SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR JIDE SOFTWARE, INC.'S PRODUCTS

IMPORTANT - READ CAREFULLY: This JIDE Software, Inc. ("JIDE") Software License Agreement ("SLA") is a legal agreement between you (an individual developer or a company of software applications) and JIDE for the JIDE software product accompanying this SLA, which includes computer software and may include associated source code, media, printed materials, and "on-line" or electronic documentation ("SOFTWARE PRODUCT"). By installing, copying, or otherwise using the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, you agree to be bound by the terms of this SLA. If you do not agree to the terms of this SLA, do not install, use, distribute in any manner, or replicate in any manner, any part, file or portion of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.

The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is licensed, not sold.

RIGOROUS ENFORCEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. If the licensed right of use for this SOFTWARE PRODUCT is purchased by you with any intent to reverse engineer, decompile, create derivative works, and the exploitation or unauthorized transfer of, any JIDE intellectual property and trade secrets, to include any exposed methods or source code where provided, no licensed right of use shall exist, and any products created as a result shall be judged illegal by definition of all applicable law. Any sale or resale of intellectual property or created derivatives so obtained will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of all local, federal and international law.

GRANT OF LICENSE. This SLA, if legally executed as defined herein, licenses and so grants you the following rights:

Single Developer License. Single Developer License allows an individual developer to use APIs ("Application Programming Interface") provided by SOFTWARE PRODUCT in any number of projects that he or she is working on. A Single Developer License for the SOFTWARE PRODUCT may not be shared or used by more than one individual developer. In a project that uses the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, each individual developer on the project requires a separate Single Developer License as long as they need to access JIDE API.

Source Code License. In addition to the license and rights granted above, JIDE grants you the right to use and modify the JIDE source provided you licensed source code. Different from developer license, source code license is licensed to a team. Each team only needs to purchase one copy of source code license and share it among those developers who have their own Single Developer License.

JIDE shall retain all right, title and interest in and to all updates, modifications, enhancements and derivative works, in whole or in part, of the JIDE Source Code created by you, including all copyrights subsisting therein, to the extent such modifications, enhancements or derivative works contain copyrightable code or expression derived from the JIDE source code; provided, however, that JIDE grants to you a fully-paid, royalty free license, to use copy and modify such updates, modifications, enhancements and derivative works or copies thereof for use as authorized in this LICENSE.

You may not distribute the JIDE source code, or any modified version or derivative work of the JIDE source code, in source code form.

JIDE require all developers in your project who plan to access JIDE source code signing on the source code license. As long as they signed, they become registered developers. An alternative to this is to let a delegate signs source code license as an organization. The delegate will be responsible for letting other developers who plan to access the source code reviewing this license agreement first before releasing them the access.

The source code contained herein and in related files is provided to the registered developer for the purposes of education and troubleshooting. Under no circumstances may any portion of the source code be distributed, disclosed or otherwise made available to any third party without the express written consent of JIDE.

Under no circumstances may the source code be used in whole or in part, as the basis for creating a product that provides the same, or substantially the same, functionality as any JIDE products.

The registered developer acknowledges that this source code contains valuable and proprietary trade secrets of JIDE. The registered developer agrees to expend every effort to insure its confidentiality. For example, under no circumstances may the registered developer allow to put the source code on an internal network where he or she has no control.

Due to the insecurity of Java byte-code, if you plan to use classes that built from the source code directly, you must agree to obfuscate the classes before distributing it to your customers.

SOURCE CODE IS SOLD AS IS. JIDE DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR SOURCE CODE.

Deployment License. There is no deployment license fee unless the number of your application deployments is larger than 1000 times of the number of developer licenses you purchased and you are unwilling to acknowledge using JIDE. You can acknowledge using JIDE by showing JIDE name and/or logo in about dialog, or splash screen or including this SLA in a license folder of your product release where has the licenses for all 3rd party libraries you are using or any other places where users can easily notice. If you are unwilling to acknowledge using JIDE, a one-time, perpetual deployment license fee will be applicable.

DESCRIPTION OF OTHER RIGHTS AND LIMITATIONS.

Not for Resale Software. The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is labeled and provided as "Not for Resale" or "NFR", then, notwithstanding other sections of this SLA, you may not resell, distribute, or otherwise transfer for value or benefit in any manner, the SOFTWARE PRODUCT or any derivative work using the SOFTWARE PRODUCT. You may not transfer, rent, lease, lend, copy, modify, translate, sublicense, time-share or electronically transmit the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, media or documentation. This also applies to any and all intermediate files, source code, and compiled executables.
Expose APIs. The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is a software library. The exposed APIs is intended to be used by the licensed developers only. If such an exposing of APIs is unavoidable in your application or intended due to the nature of your application, please contact JIDE for a special agreement and is subject to extra charge to get such permission. Exposing the APIs to non-licensed developers without JIDE permission is strictly prohibited.
Limitations on Reverse Engineering, Decompilation, and Disassembly. You may not reverse engineer, decompile, create derivative works, modify, translate, or disassemble the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, and only to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law notwithstanding this limitation. You agree to take all reasonable, legal and appropriate measures to prohibit the illegal dissemination of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT or any of its constituent parts and redistributables to the fullest extent of all applicable local, US Codes and International Laws and Treaties regarding anti-circumvention, including but not limited to, the Geneva and Berne World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Diplomatic Conferences.

Rental. You may not rent, lease, or lend the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.

Separation of Components, Their Constituent Parts and Redistributables. The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is licensed as a single product. The SOFTWARE PRODUCT and its constituent parts and any provided redistributables may not be reverse engineered, decompiled, disassembled, nor placed for distribution, sale, or resale as individual creations by you or any individual not expressly given such permission by JIDE. The provision of source code, if included with the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, does not constitute transfer of any legal rights to such code, and resale or distribution of all or any portion of all source code and intellectual property will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of all applicable local, federal and international laws. All JIDE libraries, source code, redistributables and other files remain JIDE's exclusive property. You may not distribute any files, except those that JIDE has expressly designated as Redistributable.

The SOFTWARE PRODUCT may include certain files ("Redistributables") intended for distribution by you to the users of programs you create. Redistributables include jar file (or class files if you intend to package all JIDE classes into your own jar). Developer Guide of SOFTWARE PRODUCT (if any) or any other documents (such as javadoc) which are intended to teach you how to use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, and sample code are not considered as redistributables. Subject to all of the terms and conditions in this SLA, you may reproduce and distribute exact copies of the Redistributables, provided that such copies are made from the original copy of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT or the copy transferred to a hard disk. Copies of Redistributables may only be distributed with and for the sole purpose of executing application programs permitted under this SLA that you have created using the SOFTWARE PRODUCT. You may reformat or recombine the original distribution format of redistributables provided by JIDE. However JIDE will not support or have any liability for such use.

Installation and Use. The license granted in this SLA for you to create your own compiled programs and distribute your programs and the Redistributables (if any), is subject to all of the following conditions:

All copies of the programs you create must bear a valid copyright notice, either your own or the JIDE copyright notice that appears on the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.

You may not remove or alter any JIDE copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights notice contained in any portion of JIDE libraries, source code, Redistributables or other files that bear such a notice.

JIDE provides no warranty at all to any person, and you will remain solely responsible to anyone receiving your programs for support, service, upgrades, or technical or other assistance, and such recipients will have no right to contact JIDE for such services or assistance.

Your programs containing the SOFTWARE PRODUCT must be written using a licensed, registered copy of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.

Your programs must add primary and substantial functionality, and may not be merely a set or subset of any of the libraries, code, Redistributables or other files of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.

Support Services. JIDE may provide you with support services related to the SOFTWARE PRODUCT ("Support Services"). Use of Support Services is governed by JIDE policies and programs described in the user manual, in on-line documentation and/or other JIDE provided materials. Any supplemental software code provided to you as part of the Support Services shall be considered part of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT and subject to the terms and conditions of this SLA. With respect to technical information you provide to JIDE as part of the Support Services, JIDE may use such information for its business purposes, including for product support and development.

Software Transfer. You may NOT permanently or temporarily transfer ANY of your rights under this SLA to any individual or entity. Regardless of any modifications which you make and regardless of how you might compile, link, and/or package your programs, under no circumstances may the libraries, redistributables, and/or other files of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT (including any portions thereof) be used for developing programs by anyone other than you. Only you as the licensed end user have the right to use the libraries, redistributables, or other files of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT (or any portions thereof) for developing programs created with the SOFTWARE PRODUCT. In particular, you may not share copies of the Redistributables with other co-developers. If you leave the company or go to another group where JIDE is no longer used, you may transfer the license to another developer within the team. After the transfer, you are no longer allowed to use SOFTWARE PRODUCT.

Termination. Without prejudice to any other rights or remedies, JIDE will terminate this SLA upon your failure to comply with all the terms and conditions of this SLA. In such event, you must destroy all copies of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT and all of its component parts including any related documentation, and must remove ANY and ALL use of such technology with the next generally available release from any applications using technology contained in the SOFTWARE PRODUCT developed by you, whether in native, altered or compiled state.

Time Limitation: There is no time limitation on using the SOFTWARE PRODUCT as long as you don't violate this license agreement.
UPGRADES. If the SOFTWARE PRODUCT is labeled as an upgrade, you must be properly licensed to use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT identified by JIDE as being eligible for the upgrade in order to use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT. A SOFTWARE PRODUCT labeled as an upgrade replaces and/or supplements the SOFTWARE PRODUCT that formed the basis for your eligibility for the upgrade, and together constitute a single SOFTWARE PRODUCT. You may use the resulting upgraded SOFTWARE PRODUCT only in accordance with all the terms of this SLA.

COPYRIGHT. All title and copyrights in and to the SOFTWARE PRODUCT (including but not limited to any images, demos, source code, intermediate files, packages, photographs, animations, video, audio, music, text, and "applets" incorporated into the SOFTWARE PRODUCT), the accompanying printed materials, and any copies of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT are owned by JIDE or its subsidiaries. The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is protected by copyright laws and international treaty provisions. Therefore, you must treat the SOFTWARE PRODUCT like any other copyrighted material except that you may install the SOFTWARE PRODUCT for use by you, a single developer. You may not copy any printed materials accompanying the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.

GENERAL PROVISIONS. This SLA may only be modified in writing signed by you and an authorized officer of JIDE. If any provision of this SLA is found void or unenforceable, the remainder will remain valid and enforceable according to its terms.

MISCELLANEOUS. If you acquired this product in the United States, this SLA is governed by the laws of the State of CA.

If this SOFTWARE PRODUCT was acquired outside the United States, then you, agree and ascend to the adherence to all applicable international treaties regarding copyright and intellectual property rights which shall also apply. In addition, you agree that any local law(s) to the benefit and protection of JIDE ownership of, and interest in, its intellectual property and right of recovery for damages thereto will also apply.

Should you have any questions concerning this SLA, or if you desire to contact JIDE for any reason, please contact us via our support web pages at http://www.jidesoft.com/.

THE PRODUCT AND ANY RELATED DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT. THE ENTIRE RISK ARISING OUT OF USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE PRODUCT REMAINS WITH YOU.
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL JIDE OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, ANY OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS, ATTORNEY FEES AND COURT COSTS) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT OR THE PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES, EVEN IF JIDE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

  The contents of this file are subject to the restrictions and limitations
  set forth in the SYNOPSYS Open Source License Version 1.0  (the "License"); 
  you may not use this file except in compliance with such restrictions 
  and limitations. You may obtain instructions on how to receive a copy of 
  the License at
  http://www.synopsys.com/partners/tapin/tapinprogram.html. 
  Software distributed by Original Contributor under the License is 
  distributed on an "AS IS" basis, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, either 
  expressed or implied. See the License for the specific language governing 
  rights and limitations under the License.

SYNOPSYS Open Source
SDC License Agreement

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS SYNOPSYS OPEN SOURCE LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS 
"Contribution" means: 

a) in the case of Synopsys, Inc., ("Synopsys"), the Original Program, and
b) in the case of each Contributor,
i) changes to the Program, and
ii) additions to the Program;

where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was made by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.

"Contributor" means Synopsys and any other entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor that are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program. A Licensed Patent only includes claims directed towards a data structure, algorithm, technique or method that is directly implemented by the Contribution alone or by the Contribution combined with the Program existing at the time the Contribution is made.

"Original Program" means the original version of the SDC format specification and reference implementation accompanying this Agreement as released by Synopsys, including source code, object code and documentation, if any.

"Program" means the Original Program and other Contributions.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS 
a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.

b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under that Contributor's Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The scope of a Contributor's Licensed Patents shall be limited solely to the extent of that Contributor's Contribution. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations that include the Contribution.

c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.

d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS 
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

b) its license agreement:

i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;

iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

Each Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program:

Copyright © {date here}, Synopsys, Inc. and others. All Rights reserved.

In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION 
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. 

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY 
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY 
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL 
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Synopsys may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one other than Synopsys has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of California, without reference to conflict of laws principles. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

libjpeg version 9
<<<<<<<<<<xilinx-separator>>>>>>>>>>
The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,
	with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or
	fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you,
	its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.
	
	This software is copyright (C) 1991-2010, Thomas G. Lane, Guido Vollbeding.
	All Rights Reserved except as specified below.
	
	Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
	software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
	conditions:
	(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
	README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
	unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
	must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
	(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
	documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
	the Independent JPEG Group".
	(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
	full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
	NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.
	
	These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
	not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
	acknowledge us.
	
	Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
	in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
	it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's
	software".
	
	We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of
	commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
	assumed by the product vendor.
	
	
	ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
	sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
	ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
	by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
	that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file
	ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
	of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
	the foregoing paragraphs do.
	
	The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
	It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
	The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
	ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium
	but is also freely distributable.
	
	The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
	To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has
	been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
	"uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
	resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
	GIF decoders.
	
	We are required to state that
	    "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
	    CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
	    CompuServe Incorporated."

                           Version 2.0, January 2004
                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

    1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the

3), the indemnity provision (Section 9) or other Section of the License
conflicts with the conditions of the GPLv2, you may retroactively and
prospectively choose to deem waived or otherwise exclude such Section(s) of
the License, but only in their entirety and only with respect to the Combined
Software.

 *
 * This differs from Colin Plumb's older public domain implementation in that
 * no exactly 32-bit integer data type is required (any 32-bit or wider
 * unsigned integer data type will do), there's no compile-time endianness
 * configuration, and the function prototypes match OpenSSL's.  No code from
 * Colin Plumb's implementation has been reused; this comment merely compares
 * the properties of the two independent implementations.
 *
 * The primary goals of this implementation are portability and ease of use.
 * It is meant to be fast, but not as fast as possible.  Some known
 * optimizations are not included to reduce source code size and avoid
 * compile-time configuration.

                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate

MATHWORKS LIMITED LICENSE

IMPORTANT NOTICE

READ THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS MATHWORKS LIMITED LICENSE AGREEMENT
(THE "AGREEMENT") CAREFULLY BEFORE ACCESSING THESE MATERIALS (AS DEFINED
BELOW).

THIS AGREEMENT REPRESENTS THE ENTIRE AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU (THE "LICENSEE")
AND THE MATHWORKS, INC. ("MATHWORKS") CONCERNING THE SOFTWARE AND
DOCUMENTATION MADE AVAILABLE FOR ACCESS HEREUNDER (COLLECTIVELY, THE
"MATERIALS").

BY ACCESSING THESE MATERIALS, YOU ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS.

  1.1. "Licensee" means you, whether an individual or an entity, to whom
  MathWorks grants the License, and who is responsible for complying with the
  contractual obligations of the License, and ensuring that anyone permitted
  access to the Materials also complies with such obligations.

  1.2. "Documentation" means the user guides, if any, accompanying delivery
  of the Materials, as may be updated from time to time, as well as any
  reports or other feedback that MathWorks may, in its sole discretion,
  provide to Licensee.  Documentation may be delivered in printed and/or
  online forms, and in one or more languages.

  1.3. "Licensor" means any person who, or entity which, grants a license
  to MathWorks to redistribute that person's or entity's intellectual
  property.

  3.10. republish the Documentation.

4. RETENTION OF RIGHT, TITLE AND INTEREST BY MATHWORKS AND ITS LICENSORS;
CONFIDENTIALITY.  The Materials shall at all times remain the property of
MathWorks and/or its Licensors and Licensee shall have no right, title, or
interest therein, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.  The

development of which reflect the efforts of skilled development experts and
the investment of considerable time and expense. MathWorks claims and
reserves all rights and benefits afforded under all relevant laws and
regulations. Licensee shall take appropriate action by instruction,
agreement, or otherwise with any persons permitted access to the Materials,
so as to enable Licensee to satisfy its obligations under the terms of this
Agreement.  The Materials are proprietary information of MathWorks, and are
protected by copyright law, trade secret law and other applicable law.
Although MathWorks may consider a commercial release of the Materials, it
is under no obligation to do so and MathWorks reserves the right to alter
features, licensing terms, or other characteristics of any such commercial
release.

5. LICENSES FOR THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE.  MathWorks has been granted licenses
to distribute certain Third Party software.  Certain MathWorks Materials
require the use of Third Party software products that may require a
separate license from such Third Parties to use those Third Party products.
Licensee agrees and acknowledges that, to the extent that the Materials
contain any Third Party software: (i) such Third Party software is provided
on an "as-is", pass-through basis, and as such is provided to Licensee
without warranty, indemnification, support or other representation by
MathWorks; and (ii) MathWorks bears no liability with respect to such Third
Party software.

6. TERM AND TERMINATION.  This Agreement shall continue until termination
by MathWorks or Licensee as provided below.  Either party may terminate this
Agreement at any time, for any reason, upon written notice to the other
party.  Upon termination, Licensee shall promptly return all but archival
copies of the Materials in Licensee's possession or control, or promptly
provide written certification of their destruction.

7. EXPORT CONTROL.  The Materials may be subject to U.S. export control
laws or other (U.S. and non-U.S.) governmental export and import laws and
regulations.  Notwithstanding any other term of this Agreement or Third
Party agreement, Licensee's rights under this Agreement may not be
exercised by Licensee or any Third Party in violation of such laws and
regulations, nor may this Agreement be transferred to any party where
doing so would result in such a violation.  The terms of any limitation on
the use, transfer or re-export of the Materials imposed by MathWorks in any
Destination Control Statement or other document for the purpose of export
control shall prevail over any term in this Agreement.  It shall be
Licensee's responsibility to comply with the latest United States or other
governmental export and import regulations.

8. FEDERAL ACQUISITION.  This provision applies to all acquisitions of the
Materials and Documentation by, for, or through the federal government of
the United States.  By accepting delivery of the Materials or
Documentation, the government hereby agrees that this software or
documentation qualifies as commercial computer software or commercial
computer software documentation as such terms are used or defined in FAR
12.212, DFARS Part 227.72, and DFARS 252.227-7014.  Accordingly, the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and only those rights specified in this
Agreement, shall pertain to and govern the use, modification, reproduction,
release, performance, display, and disclosure of the Materials and
Documentation by the federal government (or other entity acquiring for or
through the federal government) and shall supersede any conflicting
contractual terms or conditions.  If this License fails to meet the
government's needs or is inconsistent in any respect with federal
procurement law, the government agrees to return the Materials and
Documentation, unused, to MathWorks.

9. FOR EUROPEAN UNION LICENSEES ONLY.  Any contractual provisions of this
Agreement contrary to laws implemented under Article 6 of Appendix V of the
European Union Software Directive or to the exceptions provided for in
Article 5(2) and (3) of such Appendix shall be null and void solely to the
extent decompiling, disassembling, or otherwise reverse-engineering of the
Materials is necessary to enable the Licensee to create an independent
program that is interoperable with the Materials or any other permitted
objectives specified by such laws implemented under such directive
(collectively, the "Permitted Objectives"), provided that any such
information gained is used solely for such Permitted Objectives.

10. ASSIGNMENT.  Licensee may not assign or otherwise transfer this
Agreement and its rights and obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, by
operation of law or otherwise, without the written consent of MathWorks.
In the case of any permitted assignment or transfer of or under this
Agreement, this Agreement or the relevant provisions shall be binding upon,
and inure to the benefit of, the successors, executors, heirs,
representatives, administrators and assigns of the parties hereto.
MathWorks may charge Licensee an administrative fee for any permitted
assignment.

11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  The Materials should not be relied on as the
sole basis to solve a problem or implement a design whose incorrect solution
or implementation could result in injury to person or property.  If the
Materials are employed in such a manner, it is at the Licensee's own risk
and MathWorks and its Licensors explicitly disclaim all liability for such
misuse to the extent allowed by law.  MathWorks' and its Licensors'
liability for death or personal injury resulting from negligence or for any
other matter in relation to which liability by law cannot be excluded or
limited shall not be excluded or limited.  Except as aforesaid, (a) any
other liability of MathWorks and its Licensors (whether in relation to
breach of contract, negligence or otherwise) shall not in total exceed one
hundred dollars ($100.00); and (b) MathWorks and its Licensors shall have
no liability for any indirect or consequential loss (whether foreseeable or
otherwise and including loss of profits, loss of business, loss of
opportunity, and loss of use of any computer hardware or software).  Some
states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
consequential damages, so the above exclusion or limitation may not apply
to Licensee.

12. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.  The Materials are delivered "as is" and
MathWorks makes and the Licensee receives no additional express or implied
warranties.  MathWorks and its Licensors hereby expressly disclaim any and
all other conditions, warranties, or other terms of any kind or nature
concerning the Materials (including, without limitation, any with regard to
infringement, merchantability, quality, accuracy, or fitness for a
particular purpose or Licensee's purpose).  MathWorks also expressly
disclaims any warranties that may be implied from usage of trade, course of
dealing, or course of performance.  The Materials are provided with all
faults, and the entire risk of satisfactory quality, performance, accuracy,
and effort is with Licensee.  MathWorks does not warrant that the Materials
will operate without interruption or be error free.  Some states and
countries do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts,
so the above limitation may not apply to Licensee.  Licensee may also have
other rights which vary from state to state and country to country.
Licensee accepts responsibility for its use of the Materials and the
results obtained therefrom.

13. GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION.  This Agreement shall be interpreted,
enforced and construed and the rights of the parties hereunder governed in
all respects by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, United
States of America, without regard to its conflicts of law provisions, and
both parties consent to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts
located in said Commonwealth and consent to the service of process,
pleadings and notices in connection with any and all actions initiated in
such courts.  The parties agree that a final judgment in any such action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and binding and may be enforced in any other
jurisdiction.  To the extent any governing law, treaty, or regulation is in
conflict with this Agreement, the conflicting terms of this Agreement shall
be superseded only to the extent necessary by such law, treaty, or
regulation.  If any provision of this Agreement shall be otherwise
unlawful, void, or otherwise unenforceable, that provision shall be
enforced to the maximum extent permissible.  In either case, the remainder
of this Agreement shall not be affected.  The parties agree that the U.N.
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply
to this Agreement.  The parties further agree that the Uniform Computer
Information Transactions Act, or any version thereof, adopted by any state,
in any form ("UCITA"), shall not apply to this Agreement.  To the extent
that UCITA is applicable, the parties agree to opt out of the
applicability of UCITA pursuant to the Opt-Out provision(s) contained
therein.

14. HEADINGS.  The inclusion of headings is for convenience of reference
only and shall not affect the construction or interpretation of this
Agreement.

15. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This Agreement, together with any additional
license_addendum.txt file included with the Materials, contains the entire
understanding of the parties with regard to the Materials, and may not be
modified or amended except by written instrument, executed by authorized
representatives of MathWorks and Licensee.

Licensee agrees to employ the same security measures to protect the Programs, Derivative Forms, and MATLAB Runtime as it uses to safeguard Licensee's own proprietary intellectual property, but in no event less than reasonable care. Programs may include Third Party software licensed to Licensee under these terms or under separate terms of Licensors that are accessible within the relevant Programs in the thirdpartylicenses.txt file. Should such Third Party software be provided under the Lesser General Public License, Licensee may make modifications of the work identified in Section 6 of the Lesser General Public License for Licensee's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. Any Third Party services or data accessible through an interface in a Program are governed solely by the Third Party's terms of use or Licensee's own agreement with the Third Party.

7. SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE SERVICE. During any Software Maintenance Service term, MathWorks shall provide its customary Software Maintenance Service for the Programs. As further described in the Program Offering Guide, Software Maintenance Service consists of: delivering subsequent releases of the Programs, if any, that are not charged for separately; exerting reasonable efforts to both (a) provide, within a reasonable time, workarounds for any material programming errors in the current release of the Programs that are directly attributable to MathWorks, and (b) correct such errors in subsequent releases, provided Licensee gives MathWorks sufficient information to identify the errors; and technical support for the current release. Technical support means assistance by telephone, web, and e-mail with the installation and/or use of the then-current release of the licensed Programs, including all available bug fixes and patches, and their interaction with supported hardware and operating systems ("Platforms"). Software Maintenance Service may include additional administrative support services for the licensed Programs and access to certain online features and services made available by MathWorks from time to time. Levels of support and services available may vary by License Offering. If Licensee's Software Maintenance Service expires, Licensee must pay applicable fees to resume lapsed Software Maintenance Service. MathWorks reserves the option to discontinue, in whole or in part, and at any time, offering Software Maintenance Service and/or technical support for any Program, feature of a Program, or Platform or to refuse to provide Software Maintenance Service to a Licensee whom it reasonably believes is in breach of this Agreement.

8. TERM AND TERMINATION.

8.1. Term. This Agreement shall continue until the earlier of termination by MathWorks or Licensee as provided below or the expiration of the term of all Licenses granted hereunder.

8.2. Termination by Licensee. Licensee may terminate a License at any time, for any reason. Licensee shall not be entitled to any refund if a License is terminated, except for License fees paid for any Programs for which the Acceptance Period has not expired at the time of termination.

8.3. Termination by MathWorks. MathWorks may terminate this Agreement and all Licenses granted hereunder by written notice to Licensee if Licensee breaches any material term of this Agreement, including failure to pay any License fees due, and Licensee has not cured such breach within sixty (60) days of written notification. MathWorks may immediately terminate this Agreement and all Licenses granted hereunder if, after requesting and failing to receive from the Licensee adequate assurances of compliance with the terms of this Agreement, MathWorks reasonably believes that Licensee is or is intending to breach any material term of this Agreement. MathWorks may immediately terminate upon notice this Agreement and all Licenses granted hereunder should Licensee breach the terms and conditions of Articles 2, 3, 6, and/or 10. If Licensee or any of its Affiliates commences or participates in any legal proceeding against MathWorks or any of MathWorks' Affiliates challenging or asserting any intellectual property rights in or against any of the Programs licensed hereunder, then MathWorks may, without waiving any other legal rights or remedies available to it, immediately terminate this License. The foregoing sentence only applies to (a) a Licensee who has as its principal business the holding of patents and who does not engage, either directly or through an Affiliate, in any material active business of making products that embody the patents or (b) a Licensee who engages, either directly or through an Affiliate, in a principal business of licensing or making available commercial off the shelf software to Third Parties. The provisions of this Article 8.3 apply to all Licenses, including Perpetual Licenses.

8.4. Effect of Termination. Upon termination for any reason, Licensee shall promptly return all but archival copies of the Programs in Licensee's possession or control, or promptly provide written certification of their destruction.

8.5. Survival. The following provisions survive any termination of this Agreement: Articles 1, 3, 6, 8-11, and 13-23.

8.6. Effect of Termination on Applications. Termination of this Agreement will not affect the terms of any Application Licenses for Applications that have been placed in use prior to the effective date of termination.

9. PUBLICITY. Licensee may not use MathWorks' name, trade names, logos, or other trademarks of MathWorks or any of its Affiliates or Licensors in any advertising, promotional literature or any other material, whether in written, electronic, or other form, distributed to any Third Party, except in the form provided by MathWorks, and then solely for purposes of identifying MathWorks' Programs.

10. EXPORT CONTROL. The Programs are subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to applicable export and import laws and regulations in other jurisdictions. Notwithstanding any other term of this Agreement or Third Party agreement, Licensee's rights under this Agreement may not be exercised by Licensee or any Third Party in violation of such laws and regulations, nor may this Agreement be transferred to any party where doing so would result in such a violation. The terms of any limitation on the use, transfer or re-export of the Programs included in any Destination Control Statement or other document provided by MathWorks for the purpose of export control shall prevail over any term in this Agreement. It shall be Licensee's responsibility to comply with the latest United States or other governmental export and import regulations with respect to all use of the Programs and Applications.

11. FEDERAL ACQUISITION. This provision applies to all acquisitions of the Programs and Documentation by, for, or through the federal government of the United States. By accepting delivery of the Programs or Documentation, the government hereby agrees that this software or documentation qualifies as commercial computer software or commercial computer software documentation as such terms are used or defined in FAR 12.212, DFARS Part 227.72, and DFARS 252.227-7014. Accordingly, the terms and conditions of this Agreement and only those rights specified in this Agreement, shall pertain to and govern the use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, and disclosure of the Programs and Documentation by the federal government (or other entity acquiring for or through the federal government) and shall supersede any conflicting contractual terms or conditions. If this License fails to meet the government's needs or is inconsistent in any respect with federal procurement law, the government agrees to return the Programs and Documentation, unused, to MathWorks.

12. EUROPEAN UNION SOFTWARE DIRECTIVE. For any Licensed User properly licensed to use the Programs within the European Union, any contractual provisions of this Agreement contrary to laws implemented pursuant to Article 6 of Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection of computer programs or to the exceptions provided for in Article 5(2) and (3) of such Directive shall be null and void solely to the extent decompiling, disassembling, or otherwise reverse-engineering of the Programs is necessary to enable the Licensee to achieve the interoperability of an independently created program with the Programs or any other permitted objectives specified by such laws implemented under such Directive (collectively, the "Permitted Objectives"), consistent with the Directive, provided that any such information gained is used solely for such Permitted Objectives and solely in the European Union.

13. TAXES, DUTIES, CUSTOMS. Absent appropriate exemption certificates or other conclusive proof of tax exempt status, Licensee shall pay all applicable sales, use, excise, value-added, and other taxes, duties, levies, assessments, and governmental charges payable in connection with this Agreement or the Licenses granted hereunder, excluding taxes based on or measured by MathWorks' income, for which MathWorks shall be solely responsible.

14. ASSIGNMENT. Licensee may not assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement or any License hereunder, by operation of law or otherwise, without the written consent of MathWorks. Licensee agrees that MathWorks may withhold such consent if it reasonably believes that Licensee is in breach of this Agreement or that the proposed assignment or transfer will cause a breach of this Agreement. In the case of any permitted or other lawful assignment or transfer, the terms of this Agreement including any License hereunder shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the transferee or assignee.

15. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. The Programs should not be relied on as the sole basis to solve a problem or implement a design whose incorrect solution or implementation could result in injury to person or property. If a Program is employed in such a manner, it is at the Licensee's own risk and MathWorks and its Licensors explicitly disclaim all liability for such misuse to the extent allowed by law. MathWorks' and MathWorks' Licensors' liability for death or personal injury resulting from negligence or for any other matter in relation to which liability by law cannot be excluded or limited shall not be excluded or limited. Except as aforesaid, (a) any other liability of MathWorks and its Licensors (whether in relation to breach of contract, negligence or otherwise) shall not in total exceed the amount paid to MathWorks under this Agreement in the twelve month period preceding the claim in question, for the Program with respect to which the liability in question arises; and (b) MathWorks and its Licensors shall have no liability for any indirect or consequential loss (whether foreseeable or otherwise and including loss of profits, loss of business, loss of opportunity, and loss of use of any computer hardware or software). Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above exclusion or limitation may not apply to Licensee. Licensee agrees that prior to using or distributing any Application, it will thoroughly test and validate the Application and will be solely responsible for any problems or failures.

16. LIMITED WARRANTY/LIMITATION OF REMEDIES. MathWorks warrants that MathWorks, on its own behalf or through its Licensors, has the right to grant the License rights hereunder. MathWorks warrants that the physical media provided shall be free from defects in material and workmanship for a period of ninety (90) days from delivery, or it will be replaced by MathWorks at no cost to Licensee. MathWorks further warrants, for a period of one (1) year from delivery or for the term of the License, whichever is less, that each copy of each Program will conform in all material respects to the description of such Program's operation in the Documentation. In the event that a Program does not operate as warranted, Licensee's exclusive remedy and MathWorks' sole liability under this warranty shall be the correction or workaround by MathWorks of major defects within a reasonable time. Should such correction or workaround be impractical, MathWorks may, at its option, terminate the relevant License and refund the initial License fee paid to MathWorks for such Program. All requests for warranty assistance should be directed to The MathWorks, Inc., 3 Apple Hill Drive, Natick, MA 01760-2098, U.S.A.

17. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. Except for warranties expressly set forth in Article 16 of this Agreement (or as implied by law where the law provides that the particular terms implied cannot be excluded by contract), any and all Programs, Documentation, and Software Maintenance Service are delivered "as is" and MathWorks makes and the Licensee receives no additional express or implied warranties. MathWorks and its Licensors hereby expressly disclaim any and all other conditions, warranties, or other terms of any kind or nature concerning the Programs, Documentation, and Software Maintenance Service (including, without limitation, any with regard to infringement, merchantability, quality, accuracy, or fitness for a particular purpose or Licensee's purpose). MathWorks also expressly disclaims any warranties that may be implied from usage of trade, course of dealing, or course of performance. Except for the express warranties stated in Article 16 of this Agreement, the Programs, Documentation, and Software Maintenance Service are provided with all faults, and the entire risk of satisfactory quality, performance, accuracy, and effort is with Licensee. MathWorks does not warrant that the Programs and Documentation will operate without interruption or be error free. Some states and countries do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, so the above limitation may not apply to Licensee. The warranty in Article 16 gives Licensee specific legal rights and Licensee may also have other rights which vary from state to state and country to country. Licensee accepts responsibility for its use of the Programs and the results obtained from their use. MathWorks shall have no support or warranty obligations, and disclaims all liability, for Applications developed or distributed by Licensee. Licensee will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless MathWorks and its Licensors, officers, directors, employees, agents and resellers from and against any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable fees of MathWorks' attorneys) arising out of any Third Party claim or demand based on or arising from, out of or in connection with (i) the creation, use, or distribution of any Applications by Licensee or any of its Affiliates or (ii) the use of the Programs by Licensee or any of its Affiliates in breach of this Agreement.

18. GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION. This Agreement shall be interpreted, enforced and construed and governed in all respects by the laws of the State of Delaware, United States of America, without regard to its conflicts of law provisions. Both parties consent to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in the State of Delaware and consent to the service of process, pleadings and notices in connection with any and all actions initiated in such courts. The parties agree that a final judgment in any action or proceeding in Delaware shall be conclusive and binding and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction. To the extent that the acceptance of a contractual term contained in this Agreement is prohibited by reason of Licensee's sovereign immunity or any foreign, federal or state constitution, law, treaty, or regulation, the conflicting term of this Agreement shall be superseded only to the extent required. If any provision of this Agreement shall be otherwise unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible. In either case, the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected. The parties agree that neither the U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods nor the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act, or any version thereof, in any form ("UCITA"), shall apply to this Agreement. To the extent that UCITA is applicable by reason of its adoption in a state, the parties agree to opt out of the applicability of UCITA pursuant to their Opt-Out provision(s).

19. COMPLIANCE WITH LICENSES. Licensee agrees to notify MathWorks promptly upon discovery of any failure to comply with this Agreement. Licensee agrees that, no more than once every twelve (12) months or within a reasonable time after a transfer, in addition to any other remedies at law or in equity, MathWorks or its authorized representative shall, upon reasonable prior notice, have the right to inspect Licensee's and Licensee's Affiliates' records, systems, and facilities, during normal business hours, to verify that Licensee's and its Affiliates' use of the Programs is in conformity with valid licenses and otherwise complies with this Agreement. If a verification discloses that Licensee's or any of its Affiliates' use is not in conformity with a valid license, Licensee shall immediately take all necessary steps to cure any past defaults, including paying any unpaid license fees, to bring Licensee's or any of its Affiliates' use into conformity.

20. LICENSE MANAGEMENT AND USAGE INFORMATION. The Programs contain technology for license management and for the prevention of unlicensed use. When Programs are activated, installed, or first used by a Licensed User, and periodically for license management and product improvement purposes, information about the License, use of the Programs, and the Computer will be transmitted to MathWorks. This data includes the License information, Computer identification, and location. Some License Offerings also require the MathWorks Account information and the operating system user name for the Licensed User. See MathWorks privacy policy at www.mathworks.com/privacy.

21. HEADINGS. The inclusion of headings is for convenience of reference only and shall not affect the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

22. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement contains the entire understanding of the parties and may not be modified, amended, or superseded except by a written agreement signed by MathWorks and Licensee. In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and any purchase order executed by Licensee (whether executed before or after this Agreement), this Agreement shall prevail.

23. DEFINITIONS. The definitions are an integral part of this Agreement.

23.1. "Affiliate" means a legal entity which is controlled by, or controls, or is under common control with Licensee. Control means (i) beneficial ownership of at least fifty percent (50%) of the voting securities of a corporation or other business organization with voting securities, or (ii) a fifty percent (50%) or greater interest in the profits and capital of a partnership or other business organization without voting securities, provided that no other individual or entity other than the Licensee also has an equal fifty percent (50%) ownership or interest in the legal entity.

PART TWO: DEPLOYMENT RIGHTS

The Software License Agreement grants a Licensee and its Licensed Users ("you") the limited rights to install and use Programs in accordance with the License Offering you acquire. The Software License Agreement does not grant you the right to modify or distribute Programs or Program Components or create derivative works. This Part Two sets forth additional limited rights to modify, create derivative works of, and/or distribute certain Program Components as specifically set forth below.

Certain Programs, such as the MATLAB Compiler and the Coder Programs, generate output in the form of Source Code, Object Code, or other files and materials. For example, the MATLAB Compiler can be used to create an executable program, and MATLAB Coder and other Coder Programs can be used to generate Source Code in C and C++. Under certain circumstances described below, you are permitted to use and distribute the files, models, Applications, and Generated Forms that you create using the Programs.

Some Programs are technically prevented from being compiled, distributed, called from a web application, or used with MDCS.

All rights described below are limited by the restrictions of your License Offering, this Program Offering Guide, and the Software License Agreement.

1. Deployment Rights for User Files

You may distribute or sublicense User Files without restriction, provided that a principal purpose of the distribution or sublicense is not to replace or replicate a Program or any part of a Program and you otherwise comply with the general restrictions of the Software License Agreement and your License Offering. "User Files" are MATLAB code files, Simulink model files, MEX-files, MAT-files, VHDL-files, Verilog-files, FIG-files or P-files that you create and that do not include any code obtained from MATLAB code files, Simulink model files, MAT-files, VHDL-files, Verilog-files, TLC-files, P-code, C/C++ files or other Source Code files supplied with the Programs.

2. Deployment Rights for Derivative Forms

Your rights to create, use and distribute Derivative Forms are limited to those rights expressly set forth in this Section 2.

You may distribute Derivative Forms to Third Parties only (a) as expressly permitted in Section 3.4 (API Code) below, or (b) if the Third Party is bound by a Software License Agreement with MathWorks that requires such Third Party to treat such Derivative Forms received from you as its own Derivative Form under its Software License Agreement.

If you receive software that is a Derivative Form under a Third Party's Software License Agreement with MathWorks, or would otherwise be a Derivative Form under the terms of your Software License Agreement, then you must treat such software as a Derivative Form as if you modified or generated the software yourself.

3. Deployment Rights for Generated Forms and Applications

Your rights to create, use and distribute Generated Forms and Applications are limited to those rights expressly set forth in this Section 3.

No further license or royalty fees shall be due to MathWorks for deployment as expressly permitted in this Section, regardless of whether the deployment is solely for your Internal Operations or to Third Parties.

3.1. MATLAB Compiler

If you license the MATLAB Compiler, you may create and deploy Applications generated by the MATLAB Compiler that meet the requirements of this Section and comply with the restrictions in the Software License Agreement.

These Applications may include compiled versions of MATLAB code files, but only as required for the Application and from Programs that you have licensed. You may also use and distribute the MATLAB Runtime together with these Applications for the sole purpose of running the Applications. However, you are prohibited from making copies of the MATLAB Runtime accessible to any Third Party separate from or for use other than with your Application, and from providing the MATLAB Runtime for service bureau or similar service use.

If you license the Parallel Computing Toolbox (PCT) and generate an Application using any functionality of the PCT, that Application may enable up to the number of workers provided by the PCT used to build the Application. End-users of your Application do not need to have a license to the PCT.

Your exercise of any of the rights granted here is subject to the restrictions in the Software License Agreement, including the following:

i) You may not distribute any library header files.

ii) You may not use your Application to enable access to the code generation capabilities of Programs or the capabilities of other Transformation Programs.

iii) Your Application may not provide capability similar to the capabilities of any of Programs, or provide functionality or behavior similar to that of the MATLAB command line or scripting and programming capabilities. Your Application also may not enable evaluation of end-user code or expressions.

iv) Your Application may not provide access to all or a substantial portion of a Program.

v) You must include the notice "MATLAB(r). (c) 1984 - [INSERT YEAR MATLAB VERSION PUBLISHED] The MathWorks, Inc." in your Application's About Box, or similar visible location, and in the applicable documentation distributed with each copy of your Application.

vi) You may not modify or remove any proprietary notices included with Programs or Program Components.

3.2. Coder Programs

This Section discusses the deployment rights MathWorks grants you in conjunction with your license and use of the Coder Programs: 1) MATLAB Coder, 2) Simulink Coder, 3) Embedded Coder, 4) HDL Coder, 5) Filter Design HDL Coder, and 6) Simulink PLC Coder.

The Coder Programs take content that you choose to input. Depending on the Coder Program you use, the input could be a Simulink model, a Stateflow diagram, or MATLAB code. The Coder Program then converts this input to code in C/C++, VHDL/Verilog or PLC structured text. You may copy and deploy these Generated Forms for use outside of the Programs.

In order to enable this output code to work, each of these Coder Programs will link in certain files proprietary to MathWorks, which may include C, C++, Assembly, linker command files, template makefiles, project files, or TLC source code files. You may only copy, modify, and deploy these proprietary MathWorks files in Source Code or Linked Object Code form for different development targets when used with the Coder Programs or with code generated by the Coder Programs as part of, and only as required by, a larger standalone application. A standalone application is an Application created using programming languages and tools other than the Programs, which executes outside of the Programs.

3.3. Simulink Real-Time

You may use Simulink Real-Time to develop Applications that include Object Code derived from Program Components of Simulink Real-Time that are required by the Application and that have been compiled or otherwise obtained from Simulink Coder on a single development Computer, download that Application to a target Computer, and distribute that Application beyond the target Computer.

3.4. API Code

Programs you license may include selected Source Code and shared Object Code library files that implement various documented application programming interface (API) capabilities.

You may use and modify such Source Code files solely for creation of your own Application. You may copy and distribute Object Code compiled from this Source Code, but only as either a standalone Object Code file or Object Code linked to your Application, and only for use with and deployment of your own Application.

You may use, copy and distribute shared Object Code library files from the Programs for deployment of your own Application, but only if a header file exists in the Program for the shared library file. However, you may not copy or distribute the header files. You may not transfer Source Code, development rights or development capabilities for any Source Code or Object Code from the Programs to any Third Party.

3.5. MAT-Files

You may create and distribute Applications that read MAT-files using the MAT-file API, but if you distribute such Applications to third parties, they must also implement MAT-file write capability.

4. Application License

If you are distributing an Application, you must accompany the Application with a written Application License. See the Glossary for Application License requirements. The only exceptions to this requirement are when you are distributing an Application solely for Internal Operations, or within an embedded system not covered by a license agreement.

<<<<<<<<<<xilinx-separator>>>>>>>>>>


License agreement for matplotlib versions 1.3.0 and later
=========================================================

1. This LICENSE AGREEMENT is between the Matplotlib Development Team
("MDT"), and the Individual or Organization ("Licensee") accessing and
otherwise using matplotlib software in source or binary form and its
associated documentation.

2. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, MDT
hereby grants Licensee a nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide license
to reproduce, analyze, test, perform and/or display publicly, prepare
derivative works, distribute, and otherwise use matplotlib
alone or in any derivative version, provided, however, that MDT's
License Agreement and MDT's notice of copyright, i.e., "Copyright (c)
2012- Matplotlib Development Team; All Rights Reserved" are retained in
matplotlib  alone or in any derivative version prepared by
Licensee.

3. In the event Licensee prepares a derivative work that is based on or
incorporates matplotlib or any part thereof, and wants to
make the derivative work available to others as provided herein, then
Licensee hereby agrees to include in any such work a brief summary of
the changes made to matplotlib .

4. MDT is making matplotlib available to Licensee on an "AS
IS" basis.  MDT MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED.  BY WAY OF EXAMPLE, BUT NOT LIMITATION, MDT MAKES NO AND
DISCLAIMS ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS
FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR THAT THE USE OF MATPLOTLIB
WILL NOT INFRINGE ANY THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.

Licensee agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of this License
Agreement.

Copyright Policy
John Hunter began matplotlib around 2003. Since shortly before his passing in 2012, Michael Droettboom has been the lead maintainer of matplotlib, but, as has always been the case, matplotlib is the work of many.

Prior to July of 2013, and the 1.3.0 release, the copyright of the source code was held by John Hunter. As of July 2013, and the 1.3.0 release, matplotlib has moved to a shared copyright model.

matplotlib uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright over their contributions to matplotlib. But, it is important to note that these contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the matplotlib source code, in its entirety, is not the copyright of any single person or institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire matplotlib Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the change to one of the matplotlib repositories.

The Matplotlib Development Team is the set of all contributors to the matplotlib project. A full list can be obtained from the git version control logs.

>>> FreeRTOS
The FreeRTOS source code is licensed by a *modified* GNU General Public
License (GPL).  The modification is provided in the form of an exception.

NOTE: The modification to the GPL is included to allow you to distribute a
combined work that includes FreeRTOS without being obliged to provide the source
code for proprietary components outside of the FreeRTOS kernel.



----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The FreeRTOS GPL Exception Text:

Any FreeRTOS source code, whether modified or in it's original release form,
or whether in whole or in part, can only be distributed by you under the terms
of the GNU General Public License plus this exception. An independent module is
a module which is not derived from or based on FreeRTOS.

Clause 1:

Linking FreeRTOS statically or dynamically with other modules is making a
combined work based on FreeRTOS. Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU
General Public License cover the whole combination.

As a special exception, the copyright holder of FreeRTOS gives you permission
to link FreeRTOS with independent modules that communicate with FreeRTOS
solely through the FreeRTOS API interface, regardless of the license terms of
these independent modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting combined
work under terms of your choice, provided that

  + Every copy of the combined work is accompanied by a written statement that
  details to the recipient the version of FreeRTOS used and an offer by yourself
  to provide the FreeRTOS source code (including any modifications you may have
  made) should the recipient request it.

  + The combined work is not itself an RTOS, scheduler, kernel or related product.

  + The independent modules add significant and primary functionality to FreeRTOS
  and do not merely extend the existing functionality already present in FreeRTOS.

Clause 2:

FreeRTOS may not be used for any competitive or comparative purpose, including the
publication of any form of run time or compile time metric, without the express
permission of Real Time Engineers Ltd. (this is the norm within the industry and
is intended to ensure information accuracy).

Licensing Terms

View Revisions
Each of the various packages, which is distributed by MinGW.org, is governed by its own individual copyright and licensing terms. In summary, for the most commonly deployed packages:

MinGW Runtime: All releases of the MinGW base runtime package, prior to release 4.0, have been placed in the public domain, and are not governed by copyright. This basically means that you can do what you like with the code.
Due to inadmissibility of the public domain concept, in certain jurisdictions, we have now chosen to adopt a MIT style license for the principal components of the MinGW runtime, from release 4.0 onwards; you may view this LICENSE, as it is filed in the source code repository. Note that this new license does not carry forward to needing to distribution of said license when you use the MinGW Runtime to build your source. It only covers the distribution of the library, in source or binary form or any part thereof such as mingwm10.dll.

w32api: In the case of releases prior to 4.0: you are free to use, modify and copy this package. No restrictions are imposed on programs or object files linked with this library. You may not restrict the the usage of this library. You may distribute this library as part of another package or as a modified package if, and only if, you do not restrict the usage of the portions consisting of this (optionally modified) library. If distributed as a modified package, then a copy of this notice must be included.
This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND; without even the implied warranties of MERCHANTABILITY or of FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Due to inadmissibility of the public domain concept, in certain jurisdictions, we have now chosen to adopt a MIT style license for the principal components of the w32api, from release 4.0 onwards; you may view this LICENSE, as it is filed in the source code repository. Note that this new license does not carry forward to needing to distribution of said license when you use the w32api to build your source. It only covers the distribution of the library, in source or binary form or any part thereof such as mingwm10.dll.

WSL: We have combined the MinGW runtime package and the w32api package into one, which we have dubbed WSL, (an acronym for Windows System Libraries). We have applied a MIT style license to the sources, (where this does not conflict with any existing licenses applying to specific sub-components). You may view this LICENSE, as it is filed in the source code repository. Note that this new license does not carry forward to needing to distribution of said license when you use the WSL to build your source. It only covers the distribution of the library, in source or binary form or any part thereof such as mingwm10.dll.
MinGW Profiling Code: MinGW profiling code is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License, Version 2.
Binutils, GCC, GDB, GNU Make: All of the GNU development tools, such as GNU binutils, GCC, GDB and GNU Make, are governed by the terms of the GNU General Public License; (note that this may be GPLv2 or GPLv3, depending on the preferences of the upstream maintainers, and the specific version of each package which you choose to install; in most cases, the most recent versions are likely to be GPLv3, while older versions may be GPLv2).

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became
Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see
https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization
created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.
Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.

End-User License Agreement
The latest version of the End-User License Agreement is available on-line at:
www.mentor.com/eula
END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT (©Agreement©)
This is a legal agreement concerning the use of Software (as defined in Section 2) and hardware (collectively ©Products©)
between the company acquiring the Products (©Customer©), and the Mentor Graphics entity that issued the corresponding
quotation or, if no quotation was issued, the applicable local Mentor Graphics entity (©Mentor Graphics©). Except for license
agreements related to the subject matter of this license agreement which are physically signed by Customer and an authorized
representative of Mentor Graphics, this Agreement and the applicable quotation contain the parties© entire understanding
relating to the subject matter and supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements. If Customer does not agree to these
terms and conditions, promptly return or, in the case of Software received electronically, certify destruction of Software and all
accompanying items within five days after receipt of Software and receive a full refund of any license fee paid.
1. ORDERS, FEES AND PAYMENT.
1.1. To the extent Customer (or if agreed by Mentor Graphics, Customer©s appointed third party buying agent) places and Mentor
Graphics accepts purchase orders pursuant to this Agreement (each an ©Order©), each Order will constitute a contract between
Customer and Mentor Graphics, which shall be governed solely and exclusively by the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
any applicable addenda and the applicable quotation, whether or not those documents are referenced on the Order. Any
additional or conflicting terms and conditions appearing on an Order or presented in any electronic portal or automated order
management system, whether or not required to be electronically accepted, will not be effective unless agreed in writing and
physically signed by an authorized representative of Customer and Mentor Graphics.
1.2. Amounts invoiced will be paid, in the currency specified on the applicable invoice, within 30 days from the date of such invoice.
Any past due invoices will be subject to the imposition of interest charges in the amount of one and one-half percent per month
or the applicable legal rate currently in effect, whichever is lower. Prices do not include freight, insurance, customs duties, taxes
or other similar charges, which Mentor Graphics will state separately in the applicable invoice. Unless timely provided with a
valid certificate of exemption or other evidence that items are not taxable, Mentor Graphics will invoice Customer for all
applicable taxes including, but not limited to, VAT, GST, sales tax, consumption tax and service tax. Customer will make all
payments free and clear of, and without reduction for, any withholding or other taxes; any such taxes imposed on payments by
Customer hereunder will be Customer©s sole responsibility. If Customer appoints a third party to place purchase orders and/or
make payments on Customer©s behalf, Customer shall be liable for payment under Orders placed by such third party in the event
of default.
1.3. All Products are delivered FCA factory (Incoterms 2010), freight prepaid and invoiced to Customer, except Software delivered
electronically, which shall be deemed delivered when made available to Customer for download. Mentor Graphics retains a
security interest in all Products delivered under this Agreement, to secure payment of the purchase price of such Products, and
Customer agrees to sign any documents that Mentor Graphics determines to be necessary or convenient for use in filing or
perfecting such security interest. Mentor Graphics© delivery of Software by electronic means is subject to Customer©s provision
of both a primary and an alternate e-mail address.
2. GRANT OF LICENSE. The software installed, downloaded, or otherwise acquired by Customer under this Agreement, including any
updates, modifications, revisions, copies, documentation, setup files and design data (©Software©) are copyrighted, trade secret and
confidential information of Mentor Graphics or its licensors, who maintain exclusive title to all Software and retain all rights not
expressly granted by this Agreement. Except for Software that is embeddable (©Embedded Software©), which is licensed pursuant to
separate embedded software terms or an embedded software supplement, Mentor Graphics grants to Customer, subject to payment of
applicable license fees, a nontransferable, nonexclusive license to use Software solely: (a) in machine-readable, object-code form
(except as provided in Subsection 4.2); (b) for Customer©s internal business purposes; (c) for the term of the license; and (d) on the
computer hardware and at the site authorized by Mentor Graphics. A site is restricted to a one-half mile (800 meter) radius. Customer
may have Software temporarily used by an employee for telecommuting purposes from locations other than a Customer office, such as
the employee©s residence, an airport or hotel, provided that such employee©s primary place of employment is the site where the
Software is authorized for use. Mentor Graphics© standard policies and programs, which vary depending on Software, license fees paid
or services purchased, apply to the following: (a) relocation of Software; (b) use of Software, which may be limited, for example, to
execution of a single session by a single user on the authorized hardware or for a restricted period of time (such limitations may be
technically implemented through the use of authorization codes or similar devices); and (c) support services provided, including
eligibility to receive telephone support, updates, modifications, and revisions. For the avoidance of doubt, if Customer provides any
feedback or requests any change or enhancement to Products, whether in the course of receiving support or consulting services,
evaluating Products, performing beta testing or otherwise, any inventions, product improvements, modifications or developments made
by Mentor Graphics (at Mentor Graphics© sole discretion) will be the exclusive property of Mentor Graphics.
 IMPORTANT INFORMATION
USE OF ALL SOFTWARE IS SUBJECT TO LICENSE RESTRICTIONS. CAREFULLY READ THIS LICENSE
AGREEMENT BEFORE USING THE PRODUCTS. USE OF SOFTWARE INDICATES CUSTOMER©S COMPLETE
AND UNCONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.
ANY ADDITIONAL OR DIFFERENT PURCHASE ORDER TERMS AND CONDITIONS SHALL NOT APPLY.
3. BETA CODE.
3.1. Portions or all of certain Software may contain code for experimental testing and evaluation (which may be either alpha or beta,
collectively ©Beta Code©), which may not be used without Mentor Graphics© explicit authorization. Upon Mentor Graphics©
authorization, Mentor Graphics grants to Customer a temporary, nontransferable, nonexclusive license for experimental use to
test and evaluate the Beta Code without charge for a limited period of time specified by Mentor Graphics. Mentor Graphics may
choose, at its sole discretion, not to release Beta Code commercially in any form.
3.2. If Mentor Graphics authorizes Customer to use the Beta Code, Customer agrees to evaluate and test the Beta Code under normal
conditions as directed by Mentor Graphics. Customer will contact Mentor Graphics periodically during Customer©s use of the
Beta Code to discuss any malfunctions or suggested improvements. Upon completion of Customer©s evaluation and testing,
Customer will send to Mentor Graphics a written evaluation of the Beta Code, including its strengths, weaknesses and
recommended improvements.
3.3. Customer agrees to maintain Beta Code in confidence and shall restrict access to the Beta Code, including the methods and
concepts utilized therein, solely to those employees and Customer location(s) authorized by Mentor Graphics to perform beta
testing. Customer agrees that any written evaluations and all inventions, product improvements, modifications or developments
that Mentor Graphics conceived or made during or subsequent to this Agreement, including those based partly or wholly on
Customer©s feedback, will be the exclusive property of Mentor Graphics. Mentor Graphics will have exclusive rights, title and
interest in all such property. The provisions of this Subsection 3.3 shall survive termination of this Agreement.
4. RESTRICTIONS ON USE.
4.1. Customer may copy Software only as reasonably necessary to support the authorized use. Each copy must include all notices
and legends embedded in Software and affixed to its medium and container as received from Mentor Graphics. All copies shall
remain the property of Mentor Graphics or its licensors. Except for Embedded Software that has been embedded in executable
code form in Customer©s product(s), Customer shall maintain a record of the number and primary location of all copies of
Software, including copies merged with other software, and shall make those records available to Mentor Graphics upon
request. Customer shall not make Products available in any form to any person other than Customer©s employees and on-site
contractors, excluding Mentor Graphics competitors, whose job performance requires access and who are under obligations of
confidentiality. Customer shall take appropriate action to protect the confidentiality of Products and ensure that any person
permitted access does not disclose or use Products except as permitted by this Agreement. Customer shall give Mentor Graphics
written notice of any unauthorized disclosure or use of the Products as soon as Customer becomes aware of such unauthorized
disclosure or use. Customer acknowledges that Software provided hereunder may contain source code which is proprietary and
its confidentiality is of the highest importance and value to Mentor Graphics. Customer acknowledges that Mentor Graphics
may be seriously harmed if such source code is disclosed in violation of this Agreement. Except as otherwise permitted for
purposes of interoperability as specified by applicable and mandatory local law, Customer shall not reverse-assemble,
disassemble, reverse-compile, or reverse-engineer any Product, or in any way derive any source code from Software that is not
provided to Customer in source code form. Log files, data files, rule files and script files generated by or for the Software
(collectively ©Files©), including without limitation files containing Standard Verification Rule Format (©SVRF©) and Tcl
Verification Format (©TVF©) which are Mentor Graphics© trade secret and proprietary syntaxes for expressing process rules,
constitute or include confidential information of Mentor Graphics. Customer may share Files with third parties, excluding
Mentor Graphics competitors, provided that the confidentiality of such Files is protected by written agreement at least as well as
Customer protects other information of a similar nature or importance, but in any case with at least reasonable care. Customer
may use Files containing SVRF or TVF only with Mentor Graphics products. Under no circumstances shall Customer use
Products or Files or allow their use for the purpose of developing, enhancing or marketing any product that is in any way
competitive with Products, or disclose to any third party the results of, or information pertaining to, any benchmark.
4.2. If any Software or portions thereof are provided in source code form, Customer will use the source code only to correct software
errors and enhance or modify the Software for the authorized use, or as permitted for Embedded Software under separate
embedded software terms or an embedded software supplement. Customer shall not disclose or permit disclosure of source
code, in whole or in part, including any of its methods or concepts, to anyone except Customer©s employees or on-site
contractors, excluding Mentor Graphics competitors, with a need to know. Customer shall not copy or compile source code in
any manner except to support this authorized use.
4.3. Customer agrees that it will not subject any Product to any open source software (©OSS©) license that conflicts with this
Agreement or that does not otherwise apply to such Product.
4.4. Customer may not assign this Agreement or the rights and duties under it, or relocate, sublicense, or otherwise transfer the
Products, whether by operation of law or otherwise (©Attempted Transfer©), without Mentor Graphics© prior written consent and
payment of Mentor Graphics© then-current applicable relocation and/or transfer fees. Any Attempted Transfer without Mentor
Graphics© prior written consent shall be a material breach of this Agreement and may, at Mentor Graphics© option, result in the
immediate termination of the Agreement and/or the licenses granted under this Agreement. The terms of this Agreement,
including without limitation the licensing and assignment provisions, shall be binding upon Customer©s permitted successors in
interest and assigns.
4.5. The provisions of this Section 4 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
5. SUPPORT SERVICES. To the extent Customer purchases support services, Mentor Graphics will provide Customer with updates and
technical support for the Products, at the Customer site(s) for which support is purchased, in accordance with Mentor Graphics© then
current End-User Support Terms located at http://supportnet.mentor.com/supportterms.
6. OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE. Products may contain OSS or code distributed under a proprietary third party license agreement, to
which additional rights or obligations (©Third Party Terms©) may apply. Please see the applicable Product documentation (including
license files, header files, read-me files or source code) for details. In the event of conflict between the terms of this Agreement
(including any addenda) and the Third Party Terms, the Third Party Terms will control solely with respect to the OSS or third party
code. The provisions of this Section 6 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
7. LIMITED WARRANTY.
7.1. Mentor Graphics warrants that during the warranty period its standard, generally supported Products, when properly installed,
will substantially conform to the functional specifications set forth in the applicable user manual. Mentor Graphics does not
warrant that Products will meet Customer©s requirements or that operation of Products will be uninterrupted or error free. The
warranty period is 90 days starting on the 15th day after delivery or upon installation, whichever first occurs. Customer must
notify Mentor Graphics in writing of any nonconformity within the warranty period. For the avoidance of doubt, this warranty
applies only to the initial shipment of Software under an Order and does not renew or reset, for example, with the delivery of (a)
Software updates or (b) authorization codes or alternate Software under a transaction involving Software re-mix. This warranty
shall not be valid if Products have been subject to misuse, unauthorized modification, improper installation or Customer is not in
compliance with this Agreement. MENTOR GRAPHICS© ENTIRE LIABILITY AND CUSTOMER©S EXCLUSIVE
REMEDY SHALL BE, AT MENTOR GRAPHICS© OPTION, EITHER (A) REFUND OF THE PRICE PAID UPON
RETURN OF THE PRODUCTS TO MENTOR GRAPHICS OR (B) MODIFICATION OR REPLACEMENT OF THE
PRODUCTS THAT DO NOT MEET THIS LIMITED WARRANTY. MENTOR GRAPHICS MAKES NO WARRANTIES
WITH RESPECT TO: (A) SERVICES; (B) PRODUCTS PROVIDED AT NO CHARGE; OR (C) BETA CODE; ALL OF
WHICH ARE PROVIDED ©AS IS.©
7.2. THE WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 7 ARE EXCLUSIVE. NEITHER MENTOR GRAPHICS NOR ITS
LICENSORS MAKE ANY OTHER WARRANTIES EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, WITH RESPECT TO
PRODUCTS PROVIDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. MENTOR GRAPHICS AND ITS LICENSORS SPECIFICALLY
DISCLAIM ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
NON-INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.
8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL
MENTOR GRAPHICS OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS OR SAVINGS) WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER
LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF MENTOR GRAPHICS OR ITS LICENSORS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT SHALL MENTOR GRAPHICS© OR ITS LICENSORS© LIABILITY UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT EXCEED THE AMOUNT RECEIVED FROM CUSTOMER FOR THE HARDWARE, SOFTWARE LICENSE OR
SERVICE GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM. IN THE CASE WHERE NO AMOUNT WAS PAID, MENTOR GRAPHICS AND ITS
LICENSORS SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 8
SHALL SURVIVE THE TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.
9. THIRD PARTY CLAIMS.
9.1. Customer acknowledges that Mentor Graphics has no control over the testing of Customer©s products, or the specific
applications and use of Products. Mentor Graphics and its licensors shall not be liable for any claim or demand made against
Customer by any third party, except to the extent such claim is covered under Section 10.
9.2. In the event that a third party makes a claim against Mentor Graphics arising out of the use of Customer©s products, Mentor
Graphics will give Customer prompt notice of such claim. At Customer©s option and expense, Customer may take sole control
of the defense and any settlement of such claim. Customer WILL reimburse and hold harmless Mentor Graphics for any
LIABILITY, damages, settlement amounts, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney©s fees, incurred by or awarded
against Mentor Graphics or its licensors in connection with such claims.
9.3. The provisions of this Section 9 shall survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement.
10. INFRINGEMENT.
10.1. Mentor Graphics will defend or settle, at its option and expense, any action brought against Customer in the United States,
Canada, Japan, or member state of the European Union which alleges that any standard, generally supported Product acquired
by Customer hereunder infringes a patent or copyright or misappropriates a trade secret in such jurisdiction. Mentor Graphics
will pay costs and damages finally awarded against Customer that are attributable to such action. Customer understands and
agrees that as conditions to Mentor Graphics© obligations under this section Customer must: (a) notify Mentor Graphics
promptly in writing of the action; (b) provide Mentor Graphics all reasonable information and assistance to settle or defend the
action; and (c) grant Mentor Graphics sole authority and control of the defense or settlement of the action.
10.2. If a claim is made under Subsection 10.1 Mentor Graphics may, at its option and expense: (a) replace or modify the Product so
that it becomes noninfringing; (b) procure for Customer the right to continue using the Product; or (c) require the return of the
Product and refund to Customer any purchase price or license fee paid, less a reasonable allowance for use.
10.3. Mentor Graphics has no liability to Customer if the action is based upon: (a) the combination of Software or hardware with any
product not furnished by Mentor Graphics; (b) the modification of the Product other than by Mentor Graphics; (c) the use of
other than a current unaltered release of Software; (d) the use of the Product as part of an infringing process; (e) a product that
Customer makes, uses, or sells; (f) any Beta Code or Product provided at no charge; (g) any software provided by Mentor
Graphics© licensors who do not provide such indemnification to Mentor Graphics© customers; (h) OSS, except to the extent that
the infringement is directly caused by Mentor Graphics© modifications to such OSS; or (i) infringement by Customer that is
deemed willful. In the case of (i), Customer shall reimburse Mentor Graphics for its reasonable attorney fees and other costs
related to the action.
10.4. THIS SECTION 10 IS SUBJECT TO SECTION 8 ABOVE AND STATES THE ENTIRE LIABILITY OF MENTOR
GRAPHICS AND ITS LICENSORS, AND CUSTOMER©S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY, FOR DEFENSE,
SETTLEMENT AND DAMAGES, WITH RESPECT TO ANY ALLEGED PATENT OR COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT
OR TRADE SECRET MISAPPROPRIATION BY ANY PRODUCT PROVIDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.
11. TERMINATION AND EFFECT OF TERMINATION.
11.1. If a Software license was provided for limited term use, such license will automatically terminate at the end of the authorized
term. Mentor Graphics may terminate this Agreement and/or any license granted under this Agreement immediately upon
written notice if Customer: (a) exceeds the scope of the license or otherwise fails to comply with the licensing or confidentiality
provisions of this Agreement, or (b) becomes insolvent, files a bankruptcy petition, institutes proceedings for liquidation or
winding up or enters into an agreement to assign its assets for the benefit of creditors. For any other material breach of any
provision of this Agreement, Mentor Graphics may terminate this Agreement and/or any license granted under this Agreement
upon 30 days written notice if Customer fails to cure the breach within the 30 day notice period. Termination of this Agreement
or any license granted hereunder will not affect Customer©s obligation to pay for Products shipped or licenses granted prior to
the termination, which amounts shall be payable immediately upon the date of termination.
11.2. Upon termination of this Agreement, the rights and obligations of the parties shall cease except as expressly set forth in this
Agreement. Upon termination of this Agreement and/or any license granted under this Agreement, Customer shall ensure that
all use of the affected Products ceases, and shall return hardware and either return to Mentor Graphics or destroy Software in
Customer©s possession, including all copies and documentation, and certify in writing to Mentor Graphics within ten business
days of the termination date that Customer no longer possesses any of the affected Products or copies of Software in any form.
12. EXPORT. The Products provided hereunder are subject to regulation by local laws and European Union (©E.U.©) and United States
(©U.S.©) government agencies, which prohibit export, re-export or diversion of certain products, information about the products, and
direct or indirect products thereof, to certain countries and certain persons. Customer agrees that it will not export or re-export Products
in any manner without first obtaining all necessary approval from appropriate local, E.U. and U.S. government agencies. If Customer wishes to disclose any information to Mentor Graphics that is subject to any E.U., U.S. or other applicable export restrictions, including
without limitation the U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) or special controls under the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), Customer will notify Mentor Graphics personnel, in advance of each instance of disclosure, that such information
is subject to such export restrictions.
13. U.S. GOVERNMENT LICENSE RIGHTS. Software was developed entirely at private expense. The parties agree that all Software is
commercial computer software within the meaning of the applicable acquisition regulations. Accordingly, pursuant to U.S. FAR 48
CFR 12.212 and DFAR 48 CFR 227.7202, use, duplication and disclosure of the Software by or for the U.S. government or a U.S.
government subcontractor is subject solely to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, which shall supersede any
conflicting terms or conditions in any government order document, except for provisions which are contrary to applicable mandatory
federal laws.
14. THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY. Mentor Graphics Corporation, Mentor Graphics (Ireland) Limited, Microsoft Corporation and
other licensors may be third party beneficiaries of this Agreement with the right to enforce the obligations set forth herein.
15. REVIEW OF LICENSE USAGE. Customer will monitor the access to and use of Software. With prior written notice and during
Customer©s normal business hours, Mentor Graphics may engage an internationally recognized accounting firm to review Customer©s
software monitoring system and records deemed relevant by the internationally recognized accounting firm to confirm Customer©s
compliance with the terms of this Agreement or U.S. or other local export laws. Such review may include FlexNet (or successor
product) report log files that Customer shall capture and provide at Mentor Graphics© request. Customer shall make records available in
electronic format and shall fully cooperate with data gathering to support the license review. Mentor Graphics shall bear the expense of
any such review unless a material non-compliance is revealed. Mentor Graphics shall treat as confidential information all information
gained as a result of any request or review and shall only use or disclose such information as required by law or to enforce its rights
under this Agreement. The provisions of this Section 15 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
16. CONTROLLING LAW, JURISDICTION AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION. The owners of certain Mentor Graphics intellectual
property licensed under this Agreement are located in Ireland and the U.S. To promote consistency around the world, disputes shall be
resolved as follows: excluding conflict of laws rules, this Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of
Oregon, U.S., if Customer is located in North or South America, and the laws of Ireland if Customer is located outside of North or
South America or Japan, and the laws of Japan if Customer is located in Japan. All disputes arising out of or in relation to this
Agreement shall be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Portland, Oregon when the laws of Oregon apply, or Dublin,
Ireland when the laws of Ireland apply, or the Tokyo District Court when the laws of Japan apply. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all
disputes in Asia (excluding Japan) arising out of or in relation to this Agreement shall be resolved by arbitration in Singapore before a
single arbitrator to be appointed by the chairman of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (©SIAC©) to be conducted in the
English language, in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the SIAC in effect at the time of the dispute, which rules are deemed to be
incorporated by reference in this section. Nothing in this section shall restrict Mentor Graphics© right to bring an action (including for
example a motion for injunctive relief) against Customer in the jurisdiction where Customer©s place of business is located. The United
Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement.
17. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be void, invalid, unenforceable or
illegal, such provision shall be severed from this Agreement and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.
18. MISCELLANEOUS. This Agreement contains the parties© entire understanding relating to its subject matter and supersedes all prior
or contemporaneous agreements. Any translation of this Agreement is provided to comply with local legal requirements only. In the
event of a dispute between the English and any non-English versions, the English version of this Agreement shall govern to the extent
not prohibited by local law in the applicable jurisdiction. This Agreement may only be modified in writing, signed by an authorized
representative of each party. Waiver of terms or excuse of breach must be in writing and shall not constitute subsequent consent, waiver or excuse.

the words "Oracle designates this particular file as subject to the "Classpath"

    and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your
    choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module,
    the terms and conditions of the license of that module.  An independent
    module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.  If
    you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of
    the library, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do
    so, delete this exception statement from your version.

 * This differs from Colin Plumb's older public domain implementation in that
 * no exactly 32-bit integer data type is required (any 32-bit or wider
 * unsigned integer data type will do), there's no compile-time endianness
 * configuration, and the function prototypes match OpenSSL's.  No code from
 * Colin Plumb's implementation has been reused; this comment merely compares
 * the properties of the two independent implementations.
 *
 * The primary goals of this implementation are portability and ease of use.
 * It is meant to be fast, but not as fast as possible.  Some known
 * optimizations are not included to reduce source code size and avoid
 * compile-time configuration.

END OF COPYRIGHT NOTICE, DISCLAIMER, and LICENSE.

TRADEMARK:

The name "libpng" has not been registered by the Copyright owner
as a trademark in any jurisdiction.  However, because libpng has
been distributed and maintained world-wide, continually since 1995,
the Copyright owner claims "common-law trademark protection" in any
jurisdiction where common-law trademark is recognized.

OSI CERTIFICATION:

Libpng is OSI Certified Open Source Software.  OSI Certified Open Source is
a certification mark of the Open Source Initiative. OSI has not addressed
the additional disclaimers inserted at version 1.0.7.

EXPORT CONTROL:

The Copyright owner believes that the Export Control Classification
Number (ECCN) for libpng is EAR99, which means not subject to export
controls or International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) because
it is open source, publicly available software, that does not contain
any encryption software.  See the EAR, paragraphs 734.3(b)(3) and
734.7(b).

 * This file contains the code to link the Java Image I/O JPEG plug-in
 * to the IJG library used to read and write JPEG files.  Much of it has
 * been copied, updated, and annotated from the jpegdecoder.c AWT JPEG
 * decoder.  Where that code was unclear, the present author has either
 * rewritten the relevant section or commented it for the sake of future
 * maintainers.
 *
 * In particular, the way the AWT code handled progressive JPEGs seems
 * to me to be only accidentally correct and somewhat inefficient.  The
 * scheme used here represents the way I think it should work. (REV 11/00)

LEGAL ISSUES
============

In plain English:

1. We don't promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs,
   please let us know!)
2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay us.
3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a
   program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that
   you've used the IJG code.

In legalese:

The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,
with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or
fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you,
its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.

This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane.
All Rights Reserved except as specified below.

Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
conditions:
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
the Independent JPEG Group".
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
acknowledge us.

Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's
software".

We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of
commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
assumed by the product vendor.


ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file
ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
the foregoing paragraphs do.

The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright
by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.

It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by
patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot
legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason,
support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.
(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented
Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)
So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining
code.

The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has
been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
"uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
GIF decoders.

We are required to state that
    "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
    CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
    CompuServe Incorporated."

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE 
========================== 
 
Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting 
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands 
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's 
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others. 
 
In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for 
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us) 
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the 
software. 
 
In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to 
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same 
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope 
Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software 
Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a 
non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related 
Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of 
the PSF. 
 
All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for 
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python 
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes 
the various releases.

Footnotes: 
 
(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under 
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute 
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The 
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with 
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't. 
 
(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible, 
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to 
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1 
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL. 
 
Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's 
direction to make these releases possible.

History and License
History of the software
Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see https://www.cwi.nl/) in the Netherlands as a successor of a language called ABC. Guido remains Python©s principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see https://www.cnri.reston.va.us/) in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team. In October of the same year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope Corporation; see https://www.zope.org/). In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property. Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see https://opensource.org/ for the Open Source Definition). Historically, most, but not all, Python releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes the various releases.

Note GPL-compatible doesn©t mean that we©re distributing Python under the GPL. All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute a modified version without making your changes open source. The GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with other software that is released under the GPL; the others don©t.
Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido©s direction to make these releases possible.

 ==============

 The OpenSSL toolkit stays under a dual license, i.e. both the conditions of
 the OpenSSL License and the original SSLeay license apply to the toolkit.
 See below for the actual license texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style
 Open Source licenses. In case of any license issues related to OpenSSL

The text of the GNU Lesser General Public License, Version 2.1, a copy of which is made available below in Part Four of this document, was originally presented here, or as applicable, applies to the above-listed file(s).

RXTX License v 2.1 - LGPL v 2.1 + Linking Over Controlled Interface.
RXTX is a native interface to serial ports in java.

Copyright 1997-2007 by Trent Jarvi tjarvi@qbang.org and others who
actually wrote it.  See individual source files for more information.

A copy of the LGPL v 2.1 may be found at
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.txt on March 4th 2007.  A copy is
included below for your convenience.

This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
Lesser General Public License for more details.

An executable that contains no derivative of any portion of RXTX, but
is designed to work with RXTX by being dynamically linked with it,
is considered a "work that uses the Library" subject to the terms and
conditions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

The following has been added to the RXTX License to remove
any confusion about linking to RXTX.   We want to allow in part what
section 5, paragraph 2 of the LGPL does not permit in the special
case of linking over a controlled interface.  The intent is to add a
Java Specification Request or standards body defined interface in the 
future as another exception but one is not currently available.

http://www.fsf.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#LinkingOverControlledInterface

As a special exception, the copyright holders of RXTX give you
permission to link RXTX with independent modules that communicate with
RXTX solely through the Sun Microsytems CommAPI interface version 2,
regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and to copy
and distribute the resulting combined work under terms of your choice,
provided that every copy of the combined work is accompanied by a complete
copy of the source code of RXTX (the version of RXTX used to produce the
combined work), being distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General
Public License plus this exception.  An independent module is a
module which is not derived from or based on RXTX.

Note that people who make modified versions of RXTX are not obligated
to grant this special exception for their modified versions; it is
their choice whether to do so.  The GNU Lesser General Public License
gives permission to release a modified version without this exception; this
exception also makes it possible to release a modified version which
carries forward this exception.

SYNOPSYS Open Source
SDC License Agreement

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS SYNOPSYS OPEN SOURCE LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS 
"Contribution" means: 

a) in the case of Synopsys, Inc., ("Synopsys"), the Original Program, and
b) in the case of each Contributor,
i) changes to the Program, and
ii) additions to the Program;

where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was made by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.

"Contributor" means Synopsys and any other entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor that are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program. A Licensed Patent only includes claims directed towards a data structure, algorithm, technique or method that is directly implemented by the Contribution alone or by the Contribution combined with the Program existing at the time the Contribution is made.

"Original Program" means the original version of the SDC format specification and reference implementation accompanying this Agreement as released by Synopsys, including source code, object code and documentation, if any.

"Program" means the Original Program and other Contributions.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS 
a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.

b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under that Contributor's Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The scope of a Contributor's Licensed Patents shall be limited solely to the extent of that Contributor's Contribution. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations that include the Contribution.

c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.

d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS 
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

b) its license agreement:

i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;

iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

Each Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program:

Copyright © {date here}, Synopsys, Inc. and others. All Rights reserved.

In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION 
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. 

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY 
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY 
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL 
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Synopsys may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one other than Synopsys has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of California, without reference to conflict of laws principles. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

Academic Free License v. 2.1
============================

Copyright (c) 2006 Bob Ippolito.  All rights reserved.

This Academic Free License (the "License") applies to any original work of authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor") has placed the following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the Original Work:

Licensed under the Academic Free License version 2.1

1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license to do the following:

a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies;

b) to prepare derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon the Original Work;

c) to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the public;

d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and

e) to display the Original Work publicly.

2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and offer for sale the Original Work and Derivative Works.

3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing the address of that information repository in a notice immediately following the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.

4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.

5) This section intentionally omitted.

6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.

7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No license to Original Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.

8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the equivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by exercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.

10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware.

11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. Â§ 101 et seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This section shall survive the termination of this License.

12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this License.

13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.

14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.

This license is Copyright (C) 2003-2004 Lawrence E. Rosen. All rights reserved. Permission is hereby granted to copy and distribute this license without modification. This license may not be modified without the express written permission of its copyright owner.

2.6	Except as specifically set forth in any Copyright Agreement, Contributor shall ensure that transfers or assignments of all or any part of its right, title, and interest in and to any Contributions contributed or
 


deposited by Contributor hereunder, including all Copyright Rights and patent rights embodied therein, shall be subject to the rights expressly granted in this Agreement including, without limitation, the licenses granted in Sections 2.1 and 2.3. Recipient shall not remove or alter any proprietary notices contained  in the Contributions licensed to Recipient hereunder and shall reproduce and include such notices on any copies of the Contributions made by Recipient in any media.

2.7	License to Marks.

(a)	Accellera shall retain all right, title and interest in and to the Marks worldwide, subject to the limited license granted to Recipient in this Section 2.7. Accellera hereby grants Recipient a non- exclusive, royalty-free, limited license to use the Marks solely in connection with its exercise of the rights granted pursuant to this Agreement and to indicate that the products being marketed by Recipient are compatible with, and meet the standards of, Accellera Releases. All uses of the Marks shall be in accordance with Accellera’s trademark usage policy set forth in Exhibit D.

(b)	Recipient shall assist Accellera to the extent reasonably necessary to protect and maintain the Marks worldwide, including, but not limited to, giving prompt notice to Accellera of any known or potential infringement of the Marks, and cooperating with Accellera in preparing and executing any documents necessary to register the Marks, or as may be required by the laws or rules of any country or jurisdiction. In its sole discretion, Accellera may commence, prosecute or defend any action or claim concerning the Marks. Accellera shall have the right to control any such litigation, and Recipient shall fully cooperate with Accellera in any such litigation. Accellera shall reimburse Recipient for the reasonable costs associated with providing such assistance, except to the extent that such costs result from Recipient’s breach of this Section 2.7. Recipient shall not commence any action regarding the Marks without Accellera’s prior written consent.

(c)	All  goodwill  with  respect  to  the Marks shall accrue for the sole benefit of Accellera. Recipient shall maintain the quality of any products, associated packaging, collateral and marketing materials on which it uses any of the Marks in a manner consistent with all terms, conditions and requirements set forth in this Section 2.7 and at a level that meets or exceeds Recipient’s overall reputation for quality and that is at least commensurate with industry standards.

2.8	RECIPIENT UNDERSTANDS THAT ALTHOUGH EACH CONTRIBUTOR AND ACCELLERA GRANTS THE LICENSES SET FORTH HEREIN, NO ASSURANCES ARE PROVIDED BY ANY CONTRIBUTOR OR ACCELLERA THAT ANY ACCELLERA RELEASE OR ANY CONTRIBUTION, EITHER ALONE OR IN COMBINATION WITH ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTION, DOES NOT INFRINGE THE PATENT OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF ANY OTHER ENTITY. MOREOVER, NO ASSURANCES ARE MADE THAT ANY CONTRIBUTION OF ONE CONTRIBUTOR DOES NOT INFRINGE THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF ANOTHER CONTRIBUTOR. EACH CONTRIBUTOR AND ACCELLERA DISCLAIM ANY LIABILITY TO RECIPIENT FOR CLAIMS BROUGHT BY ANY OTHER ENTITY BASED ON INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR OTHERWISE. In addition, as a condition to
exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute a computer program, then it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before Distributing such computer program.
 


3.	DESCRIPTION AND DEPOSIT OF CONTRIBUTIONS

3.1	To  the extent Recipient  wishes  to  become a Contributor by making a Contribution, such Contributor shall:

(a)	(i) Deposit such Contribution at the Website according to the Contribution instructions found at such Website, or (ii) disclose such Contribution at a meeting of any working group of Accellera;

(b)	(i) Describe such Contribution in reasonable detail on Exhibit B (including the additions or changes such Contributor made to create the Contribution and the date of any such changes or additions), (ii) completing a Contribution Questionnaire with respect to such Contribution, and (iii) delivering both documents to the Secretary of Accellera. All Contributions  made after the date hereof shall  be effectuated  by Contributor (x) amending Exhibit B and delivering such amended Exhibit B to the Secretary of Accellera, which amended exhibit shall automatically replace the existing Exhibit B, (y) completing a Contribution Questionnaire with respect to such Contribution, and (z) delivering both documents to the Secretary of Accellera;

(c)	Cause such Contribution to contain a file documenting such Contributor's name and contact information, additions or changes such Contributor made to create the Contribution, and the date of any such changes or additions; and

(d)	Cause such Contribution to include in each file a prominent statement substantially similar to the following: “Any code contained in this Contribution is derived, directly or indirectly, from the SystemC source code. Copyright© 1996-[current year here] by all Contributors. All Rights reserved. The contents of this file are subject to the restrictions and limitations set forth in the SystemC Open Source License Version 3.1 (the “License”). You may not use this file except in compliance with such restrictions and limitations. You may obtain instructions on how to receive a copy of the License at http://www.accellera.org/. Software distributed by Contributors under the License is distributed exclusively on an “AS IS” basis, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, either express or implied. See the License for the specific language governing rights and limitations under the License.”

3.2	Accellera may from time to time publish policies and procedures regarding the contribution or depositing of Contributions as well as establish additional details regarding the contribution process. Without limiting the foregoing, Accellera or the administrators of the Website shall have the right to remove any Contribution from the Website at any time.

4.	REQUIREMENTS OF DISTRIBUTION

4.1	A Recipient may choose to Distribute any Contribution or any compilation of multiple Contributions (except for any Code Contributions) under its own license agreement provided that:

(a)	Recipient complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;

(b)	As between Recipient and any other Contributor, Recipient assumes all warranties and conditions, express and implied, and all liability for damages arising out of its Distribution; and

(c)	Recipient makes available to recipients of such Distribution then Source Code for such Distributions, and informs them on how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
 


4.2	If a Recipient chooses to Distribute any Code Contribution or compilations of Code Contributions then:

(a)	Such Code Contribution must be Distributed under this Agreement; and

(b)	A copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of such Code Contribution.

4.3	Each Recipient must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Code Contribution so Distributed: “Copyright© 1996-[current year here], by all Contributors. All rights reserved.”

4.4	In addition, each Recipient that creates and Distributes or otherwise transfers a Modification whether or not such Modification has been deposited pursuant to Section 3 must identify the originator of such Modification in a manner that reasonably allows third parties to identify the originator of the Modification.

4.5	A Recipient may choose to Distribute the Accellera Documentation under its own license agreement, provided that Recipient complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Each Recipient must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Accellera Documentation so Distributed or transferred: “Copyright© 1996-[current year here], by Accellera Systems Initiative. All rights reserved.”

In addition, each Recipient that creates and Distributes a modification or Derivative work of the Accellera Documentation, whether or not such modification or Derivative work has been contributed pursuant to a Copyright Agreement must identify the originator of such modification or Derivative work in a manner that reasonably allows third parties to identify the originator of the modification or derivative work.

5.	INDEMNIFICATION

Any Recipient which Distributes any Contribution and/or Accellera Release (a “Distributor”) may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of Contributions Accellera Documentation and Accellera Releases, a Distributor shall Distribute such Contributions, Accellera Documentation and Accellera Releases in a manner which does not create potential liability for the Contributors. Therefore each Distributor hereby agrees to  defend  and  indemnify every Contributor (“Indemnified Contributor”) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively “Losses”) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Distributor, including but not limited to the terms and conditions under which Distributor offered such Contributions, Accellera Documentation and/or Accellera Releases in connection with its Distribution thereof. The obligations in this Section 5 do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement of any Contribution, Accellera Documentation or Accellera Release.  In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: (a) promptly notify the Distributor in writing of such claim, and (b) allow the Distributor to control, and cooperate with the Distributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in the defense of any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Recipient might include a Contribution in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Recipient is then a Distributor. If that Distributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties, support, or indemnity or any other license terms related to Product X, those performance claims, offers and other terms are such Distributor's responsibility alone. Under this Section 5, the Distributor would have to
 


defend claims against the Contributors related to those performance claims, offers, and other terms, and if a court requires any Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Distributor must pay those damages.

6.	NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL CONTRIBUTIONS, ACCELLERA DOCUMENTATION AND ACCELLERA RELEASES ARE PROVIDED EXCLUSIVELY ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.	EACH RECIPIENT IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATENESS OF ITS USE AND DISTRIBUTION OF ANY CONTRIBUTION, ACCELLERA DOCUMENTATION AND ACCELLERA RELEASE AND ASSUMES ALL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS EXERCISE OF RIGHTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE RISKS AND COSTS OF PROGRAM ERRORS, COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS, DAMAGE TO OR LOSS OF DATA, PROGRAMS OR EQUIPMENT, AND UNAVAILABILITY OR INTERRUPTION OF OPERATIONS.   THIS DISCLAIMER OR WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS AGREEMENT. NO USE OF ANY CONTRIBUTION, ACCELLERA DOCUMENTATION OR ACCELLERA RELEASE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

7.	DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NONE OF THE RECIPIENTS, CONTRIBUTORS OR ACCELLERA SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF ANY CONTRIBUTION, ACCELLERA DOCUMENTATION OR ACCELLERA RELEASE OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

8.	U.S. GOVERNMENT USE

If Recipient is licensing any computer program on behalf of any unit or agency of the United States Government, then such computer program is commercial computer software, and, pursuant to FAR 12.212 or DFARS 227.7202 and their successors, as applicable, shall be licensed to the Government under the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

9.	PATENT CLAIMS

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim, counterclaim or declaratory judgment claim in a lawsuit) alleging that any Contribution, Accellera Release or combination of Contributions (excluding combinations of any Contribution with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then the rights granted to Recipient by each Contributor under Section 2 shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

10.	TERMINATION

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if Recipient fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If such occurs, Recipient shall cease all use and Distribution of
 


any Contributions of any other Contributor, Accellera Documentation and Accellera Releases based upon the rights granted  to  Recipient  under this Agreement  as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to any Contributions shall survive such termination.

11.	LICENSE VERSIONS

Accellera may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. Each  new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. Any Contribution, Accellera Documentation or Accellera Release may always be Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received.  In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to Distribute any Contribution, Accellera Documentation or Accellera Release under the new version.  No  one other than Accellera, acting by a vote of at least seventy five percent (75%) of the members of its Board of Directors, has the right to modify this Agreement; provided that Exhibit B and Exhibit C may be amended as specifically set forth in Section 3.1(b), and Exhibit D may be amended as specifically set forth in Section 1.13.

12.	ELECTRONIC ACCEPTANCE

This Agreement may be executed either electronically or on paper. If this Agreement is executed electronically, by clicking on the “Accept” button, Recipient warrants that it agrees to all of the terms of this Agreement, that Recipient is authorized to enter into this Agreement, and that this Agreement is legally binding upon Recipient. If Recipient does not agree to be bound by this Agreement, then Recipient shall click the “Decline” button  and  Recipient  shall  not  receive  any  rights  from  the  Contributors  nor  shall Recipient download any Contributions, Accellera Documentation or Accellera Releases.

13.	GENERAL

This Agreement represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements or representations, oral or written, regarding the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. This Agreement shall be executed in multiple counterparts (either electronically and/or on paper), each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall be one and the same Agreement.  A facsimile or other copy of the Agreement shall have the same force and effect as an originally executed copy thereof.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of California, without reference to conflict of laws principles.  Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation. Any litigation relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, or the Santa Clara County Superior Court. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.  The provisions of this Agreement shall be construed fairly in accordance with its terms and no rules of construction for or against either party shall be applied in the interpreting this Agreement. Recipient shall not use any Contribution, Accellera Documentation or Accellera Release in violation of local and other applicable laws including, but not limited to, the export control laws of the United States.

8) ./generic/regfree.c - "You might think that this could be incorporated into regcomp.c, and that would be a reasonable idea... except that this is a generic function (with a generic name), applicable to all compiled Res regardless of the size of their characters, whereas the stuff in regcomp.c gets compiled once per character size."

A Bison parser, made by GNU Bison 2.3.  

Skeleton implementation for Bison's Yacc-like parsers in C

As a special exception, you may create a larger work that contains part or all of the Bison parser skeleton and distribute that work under terms of your choice, so long as that work isn't itself a parser generator using the skeleton or a modified version thereof as a parser skeleton.  Alternatively, if you modify or redistribute the parser skeleton itself, you may (at your option) remove this special exception, which will cause the skeleton and the resulting Bison output files to be licensed under the GNU General Public License without this special exception. This special exception was added by the Free Software Foundation in version 2.2 of Bison.  

C LALR(1) parser skeleton written by Richard Stallman, by simplifying the original so-called "semantic" parser.  

All symbols defined below should begin with yy or YY, to avoid infringing on user name space.  This should be done even for local variables, as they might otherwise be expanded by user macros. There are some unavoidable exceptions within include files to define necessary library symbols; they are noted "INFRINGES ON USER NAME SPACE" below. 

Identify Bison output.

## About the IPython Development Team

The IPython Development Team is the set of all contributors to the IPython project.
This includes all of the IPython subprojects.

The core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here:
https://github.com/jupyter/.

## Our Copyright Policy

IPython uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright
over their contributions to IPython. But, it is important to note that these
contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the IPython
source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or
institution.  Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire IPython
Development Team.  If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what
changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate
their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the
change to one of the IPython repositories.

With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file
to indicate the copyright and license terms:

    # Copyright (c) IPython Development Team.

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-
                    from                                compatible? (1)

    0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes
    1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes
    1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no
    2.0             1.6         2000        BeOpen.com  no
    1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)
    2.1             2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         no
    2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes
    2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes
    2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes
    2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes
    2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.

Summary:
========

This directory contains the source code for U-Boot, a boot loader for
Embedded boards based on PowerPC, ARM, MIPS and several other
processors, which can be installed in a boot ROM and used to
initialize and test the hardware or to download and run application
code.

The development of U-Boot is closely related to Linux: some parts of
the source code originate in the Linux source tree, we have some
header files in common, and special provision has been made to
support booting of Linux images.

Some attention has been paid to make this software easily
configurable and extendable. For instance, all monitor commands are
implemented with the same call interface, so that it's very easy to
add new commands. Also, instead of permanently adding rarely used
code (for instance hardware test utilities) to the monitor, you can
load and run it dynamically.

Status:
=======

In general, all boards for which a configuration option exists in the
Makefile have been tested to some extent and can be considered
"working". In fact, many of them are used in production systems.

In case of problems see the CHANGELOG and CREDITS files to find out
who contributed the specific port. The MAINTAINERS file lists board
maintainers.

Where to get help:
==================

In case you have questions about, problems with or contributions for
U-Boot you should send a message to the U-Boot mailing list at
<u-boot@lists.denx.de>. There is also an archive of previous traffic
on the mailing list - please search the archive before asking FAQ's.
Please see http://lists.denx.de/pipermail/u-boot and
http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.boot-loaders.u-boot

Where to get source code:
=========================

The U-Boot source code is maintained in the git repository at
git://www.denx.de/git/u-boot.git ; you can browse it online at
http://www.denx.de/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi©p=u-boot.git;a=summary

The "snapshot" links on this page allow you to download tarballs of
any version you might be interested in. Official releases are also
available for FTP download from the ftp://ftp.denx.de/pub/u-boot/
directory.

Pre-built (and tested) images are available from
ftp://ftp.denx.de/pub/u-boot/images/

       capitalizations), "Pocket UnZip," "WiZ" or "MacZip" without the
       explicit permission of Info-ZIP.  Such altered versions are further
       prohibited from misrepresentative use of the Zip-Bugs or Info-ZIP
       e-mail addresses or the Info-ZIP URL(s), such as to imply Info-ZIP
       will provide support for the altered versions.

    4. Info-ZIP retains the right to use the names "Info-ZIP," "Zip," "UnZip,"
       "UnZipSFX," "WiZ," "Pocket UnZip," "Pocket Zip," and "MacZip" for its

<<<<<<<<<<xilinx-separator>>>>>>>>>>


MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS
MICROSOFT VISUAL STUDIO ENTERPRISE 2019, VISUAL STUDIO PROFESSIONAL 2019, 
VISUAL STUDIO TEST PROFESSIONAL 2019 AND TRIAL EDITION
These license terms are an agreement between you and Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates). They apply to the software named above. The terms also apply to any Microsoft services and updates for the software, except to the extent those have different terms. 
BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THEM, DO NOT USE THE SOFTWARE. INSTEAD, RETURN IT TO THE RETAILER FOR A REFUND OR CREDIT. If you cannot obtain a refund there, contact Microsoft about Microsoft?s refund policies. See www.microsoft.com/worldwide. In the United States and Canada, call (800) MICROSOFT or see aka.ms/nareturns. 
	
TRIAL EDITION USE RIGHTS. If you have not acquired a valid full-use license, the software is a trial edition, and this Section applies to your use of the trial edition. 
A. GENERAL. You may use any number of copies of the trial edition on your devices. You may only use the trial edition for internal evaluation purposes, and only during the trial period. You may not distribute or deploy any applications you make with the trial edition to a production environment. You may run load tests of up to 250 virtual users during the trial period. 
B. TRIAL PERIOD AND CONVERSION. The trial period lasts for 30 days after you install the trial edition, plus any permitted extension period. After the expiration of the trial period, the trial edition will stop running. You may extend the trial period an additional 90 days if you sign in to the software. You may not be able to access data used with the trial edition after it stops running. You may convert your trial rights at any time to the full-use rights described below by acquiring a valid full-use license. 
C. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE TRIAL EDITION IS LICENSED ?AS-IS?.  YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
FOR AUSTRALIA ? YOU HAVE STATUTORY GUARANTEES UNDER THE AUSTRALIAN CONSUMER LAW AND NOTHING IN THESE TERMS IS INTENDED TO AFFECT THOSE RIGHTS.
D. SUPPORT. Because the trial edition is ?as is?, we may not provide support services for it.
E. LIMITATIONS ON DAMAGES. YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.
This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the trial version, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and (b) claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.
It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.



FULL-USE LICENSE TERMS FOR THE SOFTWARE: When you acquire a valid license and either enter a product key or sign in to the software, the terms below apply. You may not share your product key or access credentials. 
1. OVERVIEW.
a. Software. The software includes development tools, applications, and documentation.
b. License Model. The software is licensed on a per user basis.
2. USE RIGHTS.
a. General. One user may use copies of the software on your devices to develop and test applications. This includes using copies of the software on your own internal servers that remain fully dedicated to your own use. You may not, however, separate the components of the software (except as otherwise stated in this agreement) and run those in a production environment, or on third party devices, or for any purpose other than developing and testing your applications. Running the software on Microsoft Azure may require separate online usage fees.
b. Workloads. These license terms apply to your use of the workloads made available to you within the software, except to the extent a workload or a workload component comes with different license terms and support policies.
c. Backup copy. You may make one backup copy of the software, for reinstalling the software.
d. Online Services in the Software. Some features of the software make use of online services to provide you with information about updates to the software or extensions, or to enable you to retrieve content, collaborate with others, or otherwise supplement your development experience. As used throughout this agreement, the term ?software? includes these online service features.
e. Demo Use. The use rights permitted above include using the software to demonstrate your applications.
3. TERMS FOR SPECIFIC COMPONENTS. 
a. Utilities. The software contains items on the Utilities List at https://aka.ms/vs/16/utilities. You may copy and install those items onto your devices to debug and deploy your applications and databases you developed with the software. The Utilities are designed for temporary use.   Microsoft may not be able to patch or update Utilities separately from the rest of the software.  Some Utilities by their nature may make it possible for others to access the devices on which the Utilities are installed. You should delete all Utilities you have installed after you finish debugging or deploying your applications and databases. Microsoft is not responsible for any third party use or access of devices, or of the applications or databases on devices, on which Utilities have been installed.
b. Build Devices and Visual Studio Build Tools.  You may copy and install files from the software or from Visual Studio Build Tools onto your build devices, including physical devices and virtual machines or containers on those machines, whether on-premises or remote machines that are owned by you, hosted on Microsoft Azure for you, or dedicated solely to your use (collectively, ?Build Devices?).  You and others in your organization may use these files on your Build Devices solely to compile, build, and verify applications developed by using the software, or run quality or performance tests of those applications as part of the build process.  
c. Font Components. While the software is running, you may use its fonts to display and print content. You may only: (i) embed fonts in content as permitted by the embedding restrictions in the fonts; and (ii) temporarily download them to a printer or other output device to help print content.
d. Licenses for Other Components.
* Microsoft Platforms. The software may include components from Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft Office, or Microsoft SharePoint. These components are governed by separate agreements and their own product support policies, as described in the Microsoft ?Licenses? folder accompanying the software, except that, if separate license terms for those components are included in the associated installation directly, those license terms control.
* Third Party Components. The software may include third party components with separate legal notices or governed by other agreements, as may be described in the ThirdPartyNotices file(s) accompanying the software. 
e. Package Managers. The software includes package managers, like NuGet, that give you the option to download other Microsoft and third party software packages to use with your applications. Those packages are under their own licenses, and not these license terms. Microsoft does not distribute, license or provide any warranties for any of the third party packages.
4. DISTRIBUTABLE CODE. The software contains code that you are permitted to distribute in applications you develop as described in this Section. For purposes of this Section 4, the term ?distribution? also means deployment of your applications for third parties to access over the Internet.
a. Right to Use and Distribute. The code and text files listed below are ?Distributable Code?.
* Distributable List. You may copy and distribute the object code form of code listed on the Distributable List located at https://aka.ms/vs/16/redistribution.
* Sample Code, Templates, and Styles. You may copy, modify, and distribute the source and object code form of code marked as ?sample?, ?template?, ?simple styles?, and ?sketch styles?. 
* Third Party Distribution. You may permit distributors of your applications to copy and distribute the Distributable Code as part of those applications.
b. Distribution Requirements. For any Distributable Code you distribute, you must:
* add significant primary functionality to it in your applications;
* require distributors and external end users to agree to terms that protect the Distributable Code at least as much as this agreement; and
* indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Microsoft from any claims, including attorneys? fees, related to the distribution or use of your applications, except to the extent that any claim is based solely on the Distributable Code.
c. Distribution Restrictions. You may not:
* use Microsoft?s trademarks in your applications? names or in a way that suggests your applications come from or are endorsed by Microsoft; or
* modify or distribute the source code of any Distributable Code so that any part of it becomes subject to an Excluded License. An Excluded License is one that requires, as a condition of use, modification or distribution of code, that (i) it be disclosed or distributed in source code form; or (ii) others have the right to modify it.
5. DEVELOPING EXTENSIONS.
a. Limits on Extensions. You may not develop or enable others to develop extensions for the software (or any other component of the Visual Studio family of products) which circumvent the technical limitations implemented in the software. If Microsoft technically limits or disables extensibility for the software, you may not extend the software by, among other things, loading or injecting into the software any non-Microsoft add-ins, macros, or packages; modifying the software registry settings; or adding features or functionality equivalent to that found in the Visual Studio family of products.
b. No Degrading the Software. If you develop an extension for the software (or any other component of the Visual Studio family of products), you must test the installation, uninstallation, and operation of your extension to ensure that such processes do not disable any features or adversely affect the functionality of the software (or such component) or of any previous version or edition of thereof.
6. DATA. 
a. Data Collection. The software may collect information about you and your use of the software, and send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to provide services and improve our products and services. You may opt out of many of these scenarios, but not all, as described in the software documentation. There are also some features in the software that may enable you and Microsoft to collect data from users of your applications. If you use these features, you must comply with applicable law, including providing appropriate notices to users of your applications together with Microsoft?s privacy statement. Our privacy statement is located at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=824704. You can learn more about data collection and its use from the software documentation and our privacy statement. Your use of the software operates as your consent to these practices.
b. Processing of Personal Data. To the extent Microsoft is a processor or subprocessor of personal data in connection with the software, Microsoft makes the commitments in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation Terms of the Online Services Terms to all customers effective May 25, 2018, at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/gdpr.
7.	SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. These license terms only give you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in these license terms. In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. In addition, you may not:
* work around any technical limitations in the software;
* reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for the software, except and to the extent required by third party licensing terms governing use of certain open source components that may be included in the software;
* remove, minimize, block, or modify any notices of Microsoft or its suppliers in the software;
* use the software in any way that is against the law;
* share, publish, rent, or lease the software; or 
* provide the software as a stand-alone offering or combine it with any of your applications for others to use.
8. NOT FOR RESALE SOFTWARE. You may not sell the software if it is marked as ?NFR? or ?Not for Resale?.
9. PREVIOUS VERSIONS OR OTHER EDITIONS. These license terms do not supersede your right to use validly licensed previous versions or other editions of the software. You may use the software and those previous versions or other editions of the software concurrently.
10. PROOF OF LICENSE. If you acquired the software on a disc or other media, your proof of license is the Microsoft certificate of authenticity label, the accompanying product key, and your receipt. If you purchased an online copy of the software, your proof of license is the Microsoft product key you received with your purchase and your receipt and/or being able to access the software service through your Microsoft account. To identify genuine Microsoft software, see www.howtotell.com.
11. TRANSFER TO A THIRD PARTY. If you are a valid licensee of the software, you may transfer it and this agreement directly to another party. Before the transfer, that party must agree that these license terms apply to the transfer and use of the software. The transfer must include the software, this agreement, the genuine Microsoft product key, and (if applicable) the Proof of License label. The transferor must uninstall all copies of the software after transferring it from the device. The transferor may not retain any copies of the genuine Microsoft product key to be transferred, and may only retain copies of the software if otherwise licensed to do so. If you have acquired a non-perpetual license to use the software or if the software is marked Not for Resale you may not transfer the software or the software license agreement to another party.
12. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software, which include restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use. For further information on export restrictions, visit www.microsoft.com/exporting.
13. SUPPORT. Microsoft provides support for the software as described at https://support.microsoft.com.
14. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. These license terms (including the warranty below), and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services, and support services, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.
15. APPLICABLE LAW. If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington State law applies to interpretation of and claims for breach of this agreement, and the laws of the state where you live apply to all other claims. If you acquire the software in any other country, its laws apply.
16. CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. These license terms describe certain legal rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state or country. You may also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the software in one of the below regions, or if mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:
a) Australia. References to ?Limited Warranty? are references to the express warranty provided by Microsoft. This warranty is given in addition to other rights and remedies you may have under law, including your rights and remedies in accordance with the statutory guarantees in the Australian Consumer Law.
In this section, ?goods? refers to the software for which Microsoft provides the express warranty. Our goods come with guarantees that cannot be excluded under the Australian Consumer Law. You are entitled to a replacement or refund for a major failure and compensation for any other reasonably foreseeable loss or damage. You are also entitled to have the goods repaired or replaced if the goods fail to be of acceptable quality and the failure does not amount to a major failure.
b) Canada. You may stop receiving updates on your device by turning off Internet access.  If and when you re-connect to the Internet, the software will resume checking for and installing updates.
c) Germany and Austria.
(i)	Warranty. The properly licensed software will perform substantially as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany the software. However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the software.
(ii)	Limitation of Liability. In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as, in the case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable according to the statutory law.
Subject to the preceding sentence (ii), Microsoft will only be liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called "cardinal obligations"). In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence.


*************************************************************************
LIMITED WARRANTY
Microsoft warrants that properly licensed software will perform substantially as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany the software. This limited warranty does not cover problems that you cause, that arise when you fail to follow instructions, or that are caused by events beyond Microsoft?s reasonable control. The limited warranty starts when the first user acquires the software, and lasts for one year. Any supplements, updates, or replacement software that you may receive from Microsoft during that year are also covered, but only for the remainder of that one-year period or for 30 days, whichever is longer. Transferring the software will not extend the limited warranty.
Microsoft gives no other express warranties, guarantees, or conditions. Microsoft excludes all implied warranties and conditions, including those of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. If your local law does not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, then any implied warranties, guarantees, or conditions last only during the term of the limited warranty and are limited as much as your local law allows. If your local law requires a longer limited warranty term, despite this agreement, then that longer term will apply, but you can recover only the remedies this agreement allows.
If Microsoft breaches its limited warranty, it will, at its election, either: (i) repair or replace the software at no charge, or (ii) accept return of the software (or at its election the Microsoft branded device on which the software was preinstalled) for a refund of the amount paid, if any. These are your only remedies for breach of warranty. This limited warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state or country to country.
Except for any repair, replacement, or refund Microsoft may provide, you may not recover under this limited warranty, under any other part of this agreement, or under any theory, any damages or other remedy, including lost profits or direct, consequential, special, indirect, or incidental damages. The damage exclusions and remedy limitations in this agreement apply even if repair, replacement or a refund does not fully compensate you for any losses, if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages, or if the remedy fails of its essential purpose. Some states and countries do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential, or other damages, so those limitations or exclusions may not apply to you. If your local law allows you to recover damages from Microsoft even though this agreement does not, you cannot recover more than you paid for the software (or up to $50 USD if you acquired the software for no charge).

Warranty Procedures
For service or a refund, you must provide a copy of your proof of purchase and comply with Microsoft?s return policies, which might require you to uninstall the software and return it to Microsoft or return the software with the entire Microsoft branded device on which the software is installed; the certificate of authenticity label including the product key (if provided with your device) must remain affixed.
1. United States and Canada. For limited warranty service or information about how to obtain a refund for software acquired in the United States or Canada, contact Microsoft via telephone at (800) MICROSOFT; via mail at Microsoft Customer Service and Support, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399; or visit (aka.ms/nareturns).
2. Europe, Middle East, and Africa. If you acquired the software in Europe, the Middle East, or Africa, Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited makes the limited warranty. To make a claim under the limited warranty, you must contact either Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited, Customer Care Centre, Atrium Building Block B, Carmanhall Road, Sandyford Industrial Estate, Dublin 18, Ireland, or the Microsoft affiliate serving your country (aka.ms/msoffices).
3. Australia. If you acquired the software in Australia, contact Microsoft to make a claim at 13 20 58; or Microsoft Pty Ltd, 1 Epping Road, North Ryde NSW 2113 Australia.
4. Other countries. If you acquired the software in another country, contact the Microsoft affiliate serving your country (aka.ms/msoffices).

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.

However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability

2. License Grants and Conditions
--------------------------------

2.1. Grants

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
    as part of a Larger Work; and

(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
    Contributions or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
distributes such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
Contributor:

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
    or

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
    Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
    its Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.

*  Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is"       *
*  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or  *
*  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       *
*  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *
*  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     *
*  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *
*  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *
*  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *
*  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *
*  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *
*  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         *
*                                                                      *

*  Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort      *
*  (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any           *
*  Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as          *
*  permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,         *
*  special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character      *
*  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *
*  goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any    *
*  and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party      *
*  shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This   *
*  limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or   *
*  personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the       *
*  extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some               *
*  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *
*  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          *
*  limitation may not apply to You.                                    *
*                                                                      *
************************************************************************

8. Litigation
-------------

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

10. Versions of the License
---------------------------

10.1. New Versions

Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
distinguishing version number.

10.2. Effect of New Versions

You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
steward.

10.3. Modified Versions

If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
such modified license differs from this License).

10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
Licenses

If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice
-------------------------------------------

  This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public
  License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this
  file, You can obtain one at http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.

If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look
for such a notice.

You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

Exhibit B - "Incompatible With Secondary Licenses" Notice
---------------------------------------------------------

  This Source Code Form is "Incompatible With Secondary Licenses", as
  defined by the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.

Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related
information available on an "as-is" basis. Creative Commons gives no
warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their
terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons
disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the
fullest extent possible.

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
     intended for use by those authorized to give the public
     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
     licensed material, or material used under an exception or
     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
	wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors

     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
     the licensed material may still be restricted for other
     reasons, including because others have copyright or other
     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
     respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations
     for the public:

=======================================================================

Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the
extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of
these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in
consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the
Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.


Section 1 -- Definitions.

  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
     synched in timed relation with a moving image.

  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.

  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
     Rights.

  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
     agreements.

  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
     License.

  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
     under this Public License.

  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
     available to the public including in ways that members of the
     public may access the material from a place and at a time
     individually chosen by them.

  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.


Section 2 -- Scope.

  a. License grant.

       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
               in part; and

            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
          its terms and conditions.

       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
          6(a).

       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
          (4) never produces Adapted Material.

       5. Downstream recipients.

            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
               Public License.

            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
               Material.

       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

  b. Other rights.

       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
          Rights, but not otherwise.

       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
          Public License.

       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
          reserves any right to collect such royalties.


Section 3 -- License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

  a. Attribution.

       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
          form), You must:

            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
               with the Licensed Material:

                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                    Material and any others designated to receive
                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                    designated);

                ii. a copyright notice;

               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                    warranties;

                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                    extent reasonably practicable;

            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
               hyperlink to, this Public License.

       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
          information.

       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
          reasonably practicable.

       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
          Material from complying with this Public License.


Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
     portion of the contents of the database;

  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.


Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
     waiver of all liability.


Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
     terminate automatically.

  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
     Section 6(a), it reinstates:

       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
          violation; or

       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
     of this Public License.

  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
     will not terminate this Public License.

  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
     License.


Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.


Section 8 -- Interpretation.

  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
     be made without permission under this Public License.

  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
     conditions.

  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
     Licensor.

  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

The whole source package can be freely distributed, including from the USA.

2007-2008 Even Rouault Oct-2009 - Mathias Svensson - Removed cpl_ from symbol
names (Even Rouault added them but since this is now moved to a new project
(minizip64) I renamed them again). Oct-2009 - Mathias Svensson - Fixed problem
if uncompressed size was > 4G and compressed size was <4G should only read the
compressed/uncompressed size from the Zip64 format if the size from normal
header was 0xFFFFFFFF Oct-2009 - Mathias Svensson - Applied some bug fixes from

      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

License Grant

Subject to the Terms and Conditions of this AGREEMENT, CODALOGIC LTD hereby grants YOU a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual right to use THE SOFTWARE. 

YOU may reproduce, install and use THE SOFTWARE in accordance with the following Conditions: 

(i) THE SOFTWARE may be used in EVALUATION MODE without a LICENSE FILE.

(ii) THE SOFTWARE can be used in EVALUATION MODE only for the purpose of determining whether THE SOFTWARE is fit for purpose.

(iii) THE SOFTWARE OUTPUT that is ultimately intended to be supplied to a THIRD PARTY (or many thereof) must be generated by a copy of THE SOFTWARE PROGRAM for which a PERPETUAL LICENSE FILE has been acquired directly or indirectly from CODALOGIC LTD.

(iv) THE SOFTWARE OUTPUT that is used to directly or indirectly develop code ultimately intended to be supplied to a THIRD PARTY (or many thereof) must be generated by a copy of THE SOFTWARE PROGRAM for which a PERPETUAL LICENSE FILE has been acquired directly or indirectly from CODALOGIC LTD.

(v) Other than for evaluation purposes and for use by students on a training course recognised by CODALOGIC LTD, a unique PERPETUAL LICENSE FILE is required for each USER of THE SOFTWARE PROGRAM. A single LICENSE FILE must not be used by more than one USER.

(vi) A unique PERPETUAL LICENSE FILE is required for each machine that autonomously runs THE SOFTWARE PROGRAM (such as a nightly build machine).

(vi) Without prior arrangement with CODALOGIC LTD, A LICENSE FILE may be transferred to another USER up to 4 times in any 12 month period. On transferring a LICENSE FILE to a another USER the previous USER must delete all copies of THE SOFTWARE PROGRAM, THE SUPPORTING SOFTWARE and any configuration files from any machine that the transferred LICENSE FILE has been associated with. (Informational note: If a LICENSE FILE that was initially assigned to USER A, is transferred to USER B and then later transferred back to USER A, that is considered to be two transfers of the LICENSE FILE.)

(viii) A LICENSE FILE must not be sublicensed, leased, rented, loaned, lent, sold, time-shared, or otherwise transferred for value to any other party.

(ix) Subject to Condition (xi), YOU may directly or indirectly supply as a component part of a larger software item THE SOFTWARE OUTPUT that has been generated by a copy of THE SOFTWARE PROGRAM for which a PERPETUAL LICENSE FILE has been acquired directly or indirectly from CODALOGIC LTD to a THIRD PARTY (or many thereof).

(x) Subject to Condition (xi), YOU may directly or indirectly supply THE SUPPORTING SOFTWARE to a THIRD PARTY (or many thereof) only in combination with THE SOFTWARE OUTPUT generated by a copy of THE SOFTWARE PROGRAM for which a PERPETUAL LICENSE FILE has been acquired directly or indirectly from CODALOGIC LTD.

(xi) Without prior arrangement with CODALOGIC LTD, YOU or any USER or any INTEGRATOR may not directly or indirectly supply THE SOFTWARE OUTPUT or THE SUPPORTING SOFTWARE to a THIRD PARTY in a form that the THIRD PARTY could compile, link, or by some other process incorporate THE SOFTWARE OUTPUT or THE SUPPORTING SOFTWARE into other software items. (Informational note: Subject to the Conditions specified herein, THE SOFTWARE OUTPUT and THE SUPPORTING SOFTWARE may be supplied to a THIRD PARTY in the form of one or more Windows DLL or Linux .so files as long as the corresponding C++ header file - for example the C++ .h file - is NOT supplied to the THIRD PARTY. This is because CODALOGIC LTD takes the position that without the corresponding C++ header file a Windows DLL or Linux .so file is not in a form that it can be incorporated into other software items.)

(xii) At the discretion of CODALOGIC LTD, a free, time-limited LICENSE FILE may be provided to a USER for the purpose of extended evaluation. THE SOFTWARE OUTPUT associated with such a free, time-limited LICENSE FILE may not be supplied in any form (e.g. compiled or otherwise) to a THIRD PARTY. The possession of such a free, time-limited LICENSE FILE does not confer any rights to distribute THE SUPPORTING SOFTWARE to a THIRD PARTY. 

(xiii) At the discretion of CODALOGIC LTD, a free LICENSE FILE may be provided to a USER who is a member of an academic institution. THE SOFTWARE OUTPUT and THE SUPPORTING SOFTWARE associated with such a free LICENSE FILE may be supplied to an ACADEMIC FUNDING PARTY only for non-commercial training purposes.

(xiv) At the discretion of CODALOGIC LTD, a free LICENSE FILE may be provided to a training provider recognised by CODALOGIC LTD for the temporary use of students attending a training course recognised by CODALOGIC LTD. THE SOFTWARE OUTPUT and THE SUPPORTING SOFTWARE associated with such a free LICENSE FILE may be supplied to an ACADEMIC FUNDING PARTY only for non-commercial training purposes. 

Any use of THE SOFTWARE not explicitly permitted by the above Conditions is expressly not permitted, unless separate written agreement has been obtained from CODALOGIC LTD.

A USER may use THE SOFTWARE PROGRAM on any number of machines subject to said machines being solely for the use of said USER.

An INTEGRATOR may use THE SOFTWARE OUTPUT and THE SUPPORTING SOFTWARE without acquiring a LICENSE FILE.

Subject to the above Conditions, THE SOFTWARE OUTPUT and THE SUPPORTING SOFTWARE may be supplied to a THIRD PARTY (or many thereof) royalty-free.

A USER may modify THE SUPPORTING SOFTWARE, but this does not change any restrictions imposed on the allowed uses of THE SUPPORTING SOFTWARE.

THE SOFTWARE PROGRAM is licensed as a single product. Except as otherwise stated, its component parts may not be separated for use by more than one USER. 

YOU or any USER must not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble THE SOFTWARE, except and only to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law. 
Copyright

THE SOFTWARE and its documentation are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and treaties. CODALOGIC LTD owns the title, copyright, and other intellectual property rights in THE SOFTWARE, and its documentation. CODALOGIC LTD reserves all rights not expressly granted to you in this agreement. THE SOFTWARE is licensed, not sold.
Right to Refund

If YOU decide that THE SOFTWARE is not suitable for your purpose YOU are entitled to a refund of the amount you paid for the first LICENSE FILE, at any time prior to YOU delivering any item that depends on THE SOFTWARE to a THIRD PARTY or within a period of 90 days from the date of order, whichever is the earlier. On determining that THE SOFTWARE is not suitable for your purpose, all copies of THE SOFTWARE associated with a LICENSE FILE for which a refund is being claimed must be destroyed.
Termination

Without prejudice to any other rights, CODALOGIC LTD may terminate this AGREEMENT if YOU fail to comply with the Terms and Conditions of this AGREEMENT. In such event, YOU and any USER and any INTEGRATOR must destroy all copies of THE SOFTWARE in your possession.
Disclaimer

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS' AND COMES WITH NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. 
 
CODALOGIC LTD SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES SUFFERED BY ANYONE OR ANYTHING DUE TO THE DIRECT OR INDIRECT USE OF THE SOFTWARE HOWEVER THEY MAY BE CAUSED.

3. Distribution Obligations
3.1. Application of License
The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2.

The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

3.2. Availability of Source Code
Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

3.3. Description of Modifications
You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
    (a) Third Party Claims
    If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained. 
    (b) Contributor APIs
    If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file. 
    (c) Representations
    Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4 (a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License. 

3.5. Required Notices
You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2.

The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License.

If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

3.7. Larger Works
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Trademark Usage
5.1. Advertising Materials

All advertising materials mentioning features or use of the Governed Code must display the following acknowledgement: "This product includes software developed by CenterPoint - Connective Software Engineering GmbH."
5.2. Endorsements

The names "CenterPoint" and "CenterPoint - Connective Software Engineering GmbH." must not be used to endorse or promote Contributor Versions or Larger Works without the prior written permission of CenterPoint - Connective Software Engineering GmbH.

5.3. Product Names

Contributor Versions and Larger Works may not be called "CenterPoint" nor may the word "CenterPoint" appear in their names without prior written permission of CenterPoint - Connective Software Engineering GmbH.

6. Versions of the License

6.1. New Versions
CenterPoint - Connective Software Engineering GmbH. ("CenterPoint") may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

6.2. Effect of New Versions
Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by CenterPoint. No one other than CenterPoint has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION

8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that:
    (a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above. 
    (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1 (b) and 2.2 (b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant. 

8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION.

     3.1. Availability of Source Code.

     Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

     3.2. Modifications.

     The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

     3.3. Required Notices.

     You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.

     3.4. Application of Additional Terms.

     You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

     3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.

     You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

     3.6. Larger Works.

     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.

4. Versions of the License.

     4.1. New Versions.

     Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.

     4.2. Effect of New Versions.

     You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.

     4.3. Modified Versions.

     When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

     COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

6. TERMINATION.

     6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

     6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as "Participant") alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.

     6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

     6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

     The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. © 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).

If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

     As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis.

Common Public License 1.0
<<<<<<<<<<xilinx-separator>>>>>>>>>>
Common Public License (CPL) -- V1.0

03 May 2005
Updated 16 Apr 2009

As of 25 Feb 2009, IBM has assigned the Agreement Steward role for the CPL to the Eclipse Foundation. Eclipse has designated the Eclipse Public License (EPL) as the follow-on version of the CPL.

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1.	DEFINITIONS 

"Contribution" means:

a. in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
b. in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
i. changes to the Program, and
ii. additions to the Program;
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.

2.	GRANT OF RIGHTS 

a. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.

b. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

c. Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.

d. Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

3.	REQUIREMENTS 
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:

a. it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

b. its license agreement:

i. effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

ii. effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;

iii. states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

iv. states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

a. it must be made available under this Agreement; and

b. a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

4.	COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION 
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. 

5.	NO WARRANTY 
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6.	DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY 
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

GENERAL 
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement.

If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by clause 4(c), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by clause 4(c), as requested.
   2. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work only under the terms of this License, a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License, or a Creative Commons iCommons license that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g. Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5 Japan).

"Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole.

to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,
to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.
If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
8. Miscellaneous

royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party
intellectual property claims:

          (a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform,
sublicense and distribute the Original Code (or portions
thereof) with or without Modifications, or as part of a
Larger Work; and

          (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or

portions thereof) and not to any greater extent that may be
necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations.

     2.2. Contributor Grant.
     Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party
intellectual property claims:

basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code or as part
of a Larger Work; and

          (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or
controlled by Contributor, to Utilize the Contributor
Version (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that
any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to
Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), and
not to any greater extent that may be necessary to Utilize
further Modifications or combinations.

3. DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS.

     3.1. Application of License.
     The Modifications which You create or to which You
contribute are governed by the terms of this License,
including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code
version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the
terms of this License or a future version of this License
released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of
this License with every copy of the Source Code You
distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any
Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable
version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder.
However, You may include an additional document offering the
additional rights described in Section 3.5.

     3.2. Availability of Source Code.
     Any Modification which You create or to which You
contribute must be made available in Source Code form under
the terms of this License via an accepted Electronic
Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
Executable version available and to the Initial Developer;
and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,
must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after
the date it initially became available, or at least six (6)
months after a subsequent version of that particular
Modification has been made available to such recipients. You
are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version
remains available even if the Electronic Distribution
Mechanism is maintained by a third party. You are
responsible for notifying the Initial Developer of the
Modification and the location of the Source if a contact
means is provided. Cygnus will be acting as maintainer of
the Source and may provide an Electronic Distribution
mechanism for the Modification to be made available. You can
contact Cygnus to make the Modification available and to
notify the Initial Developer. (http://sourceware.cygnus.com/ecos)

     3.3. Description of Modifications.
     You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute
to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create
that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must
include a prominent statement that the Modification is
derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided
by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any
notice in an Executable version or related documentation in
which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered
Code.

     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters

          (a) Third Party Claims.
          If You have knowledge that a party claims an
intellectual property right in particular functionality or
code (or its utilization under this License), you must
include a text file with the source code distribution titled
"LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the
claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom
to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your
Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You
shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make
available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as
notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
reasonably calculated to inform those who received the
Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

          (b) Contributor APIs.
          If Your Modification is an application programming
interface and You own or control patents which are
reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also
include this information in the LEGAL file.

     3.5. Required Notices.
     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file
of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation
for the Source Code, where You describe recipients' rights
relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more
Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to
the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in
a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you
must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant
directory file) where a user would be likely to look for
such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee
for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations
to one or more recipients of Covered Code.
     However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not
on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You
must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You
alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only
if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for
that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that
the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available
under the terms of this License, including a description of
how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section
3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice
in an Executable version, related documentation or
collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating
to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable
version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice,
which may contain terms different from this License,
provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this
License and that the license for the Executable version does
not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the
Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
License. If You distribute the Executable version under a
different license You must make it absolutely clear that any
terms which differ from this License are offered by You
alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You
hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms
You offer.
     If you distribute executable versions containing
Covered Code, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in
the documentation and/or other materials provided with the
product.

     3.7. Larger Works.
     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code
with other code not governed by the terms of this License
and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such
a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License
are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION.

     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the
terms of this License with respect to some or all of the
Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a)
comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent
possible; (b) cite the statute or regulation that prohibits
you from adhering to the license; and (c) describe the
limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and
must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,
such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. You
must submit this LEGAL file to Cygnus for review, and You
will not be able use the covered code in any means until
permission is granted from Cygnus to allow for the inability
to comply due to statute or regulation.

5. APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE.

     This License applies to code to which the Initial
Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to
related Covered Code.
      Cygnus may include Covered Code in products without
such additional products becoming subject to the terms of
this License, and may license such additional products on
different terms from those contained in this License.
     Cygnus may license the Source Code of Cygnus's Branded
Code without Cygnus's Branded Code becoming subject to the
terms of this License, and may license Cygnus's Branded Code
on different terms from those contained in this License.
Contact Cygnus for details of alternate licensing terms
available.

6. VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE.

     6.1. New Versions.
     Cygnus may publish revised and/or new versions of the
License from time to time. Each version will be given a
distinguishing version number.

     6.2. Effect of New Versions.
     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular
version of the License, You may always continue to use it
under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use
such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version
of the License published by Cygnus. No one other than Cygnus
has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code
beyond what is granted under this and subsequent Licenses.

     6.3. Derivative Works.
     If you create or use a modified version of this License
(which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is
not already Covered Code governed by this License), you must
(a) rename Your license so that the phrases "ECOS", "eCos",
"Cygnus", "CPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not
appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it
clear that your version of the license contains terms which
differ from the eCos Public License and Cygnus Public
License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer,
Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be
modifications of this License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

     COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS
IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT
THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU.
SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU
(NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME
THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF
THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED
HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION.

     This License and the rights granted hereunder will
terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms
herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of
becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered
Code which are properly granted shall survive any
termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this
License shall survive.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY,
WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE,
SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY
DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH
PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY
INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF
ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR
LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS
DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY
NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

     The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term
is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of
"commercial computer software" and "commercial computer
software documentation," as such terms are used in 48
C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212
and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all
U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only
those rights set forth herein.

11. MISCELLANEOUS.

     This License represents the complete agreement
concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this
License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be
reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
enforceable. This License shall be governed by California
law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any,
provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law
provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one
party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered
to do business in, the United States of America: (a) unless
otherwise agreed in writing, all disputes relating to this
License (excepting any dispute relating to intellectual
property rights) shall be subject to final and binding
arbitration, with the losing party paying all costs of
arbitration; (b) any arbitration relating to this Agreement
shall be held in Santa Clara County, California, under the
auspices of JAMS/EndDispute; and (c) any litigation relating
to this Agreement shall be subject to the jurisdiction of
the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California,
with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the
losing party responsible for costs, including without
limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention
on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is
expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides
that the language of a contract shall be construed against
the drafter shall not apply to this License.

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

     Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to
comply with Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages
arising, directly or indirectly, out of Your utilization of
rights under this License, based on the number of copies of
Covered Code you made available, the revenues you received
from utilizing such rights, and other relevant factors. You
agree to work with affected parties to distribute
responsibility on an equitable basis.

13. ADDITIONAL TERMS APPLICABLE TO THE CYGNUS ECOS PUBLIC
LICENSE.

      Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to
prohibit Cygnus from licensing under different terms than
this License any code which Cygnus otherwise would have a
right to license.

      Cygnus and logo - This License does not grant any
rights to use the trademark Cygnus, the Cygnus logo,
eCos logo, even if such marks are included in the Original
Code. You may contact Cygnus for permission to display the
Cygnus and eCos marks in either the documentation or the
Executable version beyond that required in Exhibit B.

     Inability to Comply Due to Contractual Obligation - To
the extent that Cygnus is limited contractually from making
third party code available under this License, Cygnus may
choose to integrate such third party code into Covered Code
without being required to distribute such third party code
in Source Code form, even if such third party code would
otherwise be considered "Modifications" under this License.

Eclipse Public License, version 1.0
<<<<<<<<<<xilinx-separator>>>>>>>>>>
Eclipse Public License - v 1.0
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and

b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

i) changes to the Program, and

ii) additions to the Program;

where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.

b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.

d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

b) its license agreement:

i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;

iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

Eclipse Public License - v 2.0

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSEPUBLIC LICENSE (AGREEMENT). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTIONOF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. 

1. DEFINITIONS

Contribution means:
a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial contentDistributed under this Agreement, and 
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: i) changes to the Program, and
ii) additions to the Program;
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate fromand are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution originates from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by suchContributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program thatare not Modified Works. 

Contributor means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.

Licensed Patents mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor whichare necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution aloneor when combined with the Program. 

Program means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with thisAgreement. 

Recipient means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreementor any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors. 

Derivative Works shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or otherform, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which theeditorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modificationsrepresent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. 

Modified Works shall mean any work in Source Code or other form thatresults from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of thecontents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new filein Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. ModifiedWorks shall not include works that contain only declarations, interfaces,types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely in each casein order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program or ModifiedWorks thereof. 

Distribute means the acts of a) distributing or b) making availablein any manner that enables the transfer of a copy. 

Source Code means the form of a Program preferred for makingmodifications, including but not limited to software source code,documentation source, and configuration files. 

Secondary License means either the GNU General Public License,Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including anyexceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initialContributor. 

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor herebygrants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyrightlicense to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of suchContributor, if any, and such Derivative Works. 
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor herebygrants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patentlicense under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shallapply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if,at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, suchaddition of the Contribution causes such combination to be coveredby the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to anyother combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware perse is licensed hereunder. 
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants thelicenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances areprovided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe thepatent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claimsbrought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectualproperty rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rightsand licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes soleresponsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed,if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required toallow Recipient to Distribute the Program, it is Recipient'sresponsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program. 
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficientcopyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyrightlicense set forth in this Agreement. 
e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no Contributormakes additional grants to any Recipient (other than those set forthin this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's receipt of theProgram under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted underthe terms of Section 3). 

3. REQUIREMENTS

3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, inaccordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompanythe Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Programis available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how toobtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarilyused for software exchange; and 
b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a licensedifferent than this Agreement, provided that such license: i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors allwarranties and conditions, express and implied, including warrantiesor conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warrantiesor conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose; 
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors allliability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidentaland consequential damages, such as lost profits; 
iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in theSource Code under section 3.2; and 
iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any partyto be under a license that satisfies the requirements of this section 3. 


3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the Program (i)is combined with other material in a separate file or files made availableunder a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial Contributor attached tothe Source Code the notice described in Exhibit A of this Agreement,then the Program may be made available under the terms of suchSecondary Licenses, and 
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark,attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability(notices) contained within the Program from any copy of the Program whichthey Distribute, provided that Contributors may add their own appropriatenotices. 

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilitieswith respect to end users, business partners and the like. While thislicense is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, theContributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering shoulddo so in a manner which does not create potential liability for otherContributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in acommercial product offering, such Contributor (Commercial Contributor) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor(Indemnified Contributor) against any losses, damages and costs(collectively Losses) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actionsbrought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extentcaused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connectionwith its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering.The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relatingto any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order toqualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify theCommercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the CommercialContributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in,the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The IndemnifiedContributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. 

For example, a Contributor might include the Programin a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then aCommercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performanceclaims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claimsand warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone.Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claimsagainst the other Contributors related to those performance claims andwarranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damagesas a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. 

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTEDBY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN AS IS BASIS, WITHOUTWARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING,WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient issolely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using anddistributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with itsexercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to therisks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damageto or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability orinterruption of operations. 

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTEDBY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANYLIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY,OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS),HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICTLIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAYOUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTSGRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable underapplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of theremainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by theparties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extentnecessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. 

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including across-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights grantedunder Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. 

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails tocomply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement anddoes not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becomingaware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreementterminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Programas soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations underthis Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to theProgram shall continue and survive. 

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and mayonly be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reservesthe right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreementfrom time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the rightto modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial AgreementSteward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve asthe Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version ofthe Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program(including Contributions) may always be Distributed subject to the versionof the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a newversion of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to Distributethe Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. 

Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipientreceives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of anyContributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly grantedunder this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intendedto be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement. 

Exhibit A  Form of Secondary Licenses Notice

This Source Code may also be made available under the followingSecondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forthin the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}. 


Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit Ais not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.

GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION
<<<<<<<<<<xilinx-separator>>>>>>>>>>
Version 3.1, 31 March 2009

Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.

0. Definitions.

A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
on the Runtime Library.

"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
subsequent versions published by the FSF.

"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
the license of GCC.

"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.

The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
understood as starting with the output of the generators or
preprocessors.

A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
Eligible Compilation Process.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.

You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.

2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.

The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
requirements of the license of GCC.















GNU Free Documentation License, version 1.1
<<<<<<<<<<xilinx-separator>>>>>>>>>>
                GNU Free Documentation License
                   Version 1.1, March 2000

 Copyright (C) 2000  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to any
such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
addressed as "you".

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is
not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include
PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only
by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output
purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.


2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.


3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter
option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.


4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to
   it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
   preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
   substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
entitled "Endorsements."


6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.


7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
compilation.  Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.
Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.


8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License provided that you also include the
original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement
between the translation and the original English version of this
License, the original English version will prevail.


9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.


10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

      Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
      or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
      with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
      Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
      A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
      Free Documentation License".

If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no
Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
"Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.












GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
<<<<<<<<<<xilinx-separator>>>>>>>>>>
                GNU Free Documentation License
                  Version 1.2, November 2002


 Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.


2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.


3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.


4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
   unless they release you from this requirement.
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
Entitled "Endorsements".


6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.


7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.


8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.


9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.


10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
    Free Documentation License".

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.











GNU General Public License, version 2
<<<<<<<<<<xilinx-separator>>>>>>>>>>
                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.





















GNU General Public License, version 3
<<<<<<<<<<xilinx-separator>>>>>>>>>>
                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.






















GNU Lesser General Public License, version 2.1
<<<<<<<<<<xilinx-separator>>>>>>>>>>
                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2.1, February 1999

 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library General Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>

GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3
<<<<<<<<<<xilinx-separator>>>>>>>>>>
                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions.

  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
Version".

  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:

   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
   this License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

  4. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

   d) Do one of the following:

       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
       Corresponding Source.

       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
       Version.

   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
   conveyed under the terms of this License.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.




















GNU Library General Public License, version 2
<<<<<<<<<<xilinx-separator>>>>>>>>>>
		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
 numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
your libraries, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
the original authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
free use or not licensed at all.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This
license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
the same as in the ordinary license.

  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in
a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
treats it as such.

  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.

  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to
permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve
this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this
will lead to faster development of free libraries.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
works together with the library.

  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
General Public License rather than by this special one.

		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is
addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.
  
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

     Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
    Library General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free
    Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston,
    MA 02111-1307, USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

<<<<<<<<<<xilinx-separator>>>>>>>>>>
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

    in the case of <ORGANIZATION:> ("<OWNER>"), the Original Program, and
    in the case of each Contributor,
        changes to the Program, and
        additions to the Program; 
    where such changes and/or additions to the Program were added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf, and the Contributor explicitly consents, in accordance with Section 3C, to characterization of the changes and/or additions as Contributions. 

"Contributor" means <OWNER> and any other entity that has Contributed a Contribution to the Program.

"Distributor" means a Recipient that distributes the Program, modifications to the Program, or any part thereof.

"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

"Original Program" means the original version of the software accompanying this Agreement as released by <OWNER>, including source code, object code and documentation, if any.

"Program" means the Original Program and Contributions or any part thereof

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

a. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.
b. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. The patent license granted by a Contributor shall also apply to the combination of the Contribution of that Contributor and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license granted by a Contributor shall not apply to (i) any other combinations which include the Contribution, nor to (ii) Contributions of other Contributors. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
c. Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
d. Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

A. Distributor may choose to distribute the Program in any form under this Agreement or under its own license agreement, provided that:

    it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;
    if the Program is distributed in source code or other tangible form, a copy of this Agreement or Distributor's own license agreement is included with each copy of the Program; and
    if distributed under Distributor's own license agreement, such license agreement:
        effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
        effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits; and
        states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party. 

    B. Each Distributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program:

    Copyright (C) <YEAR>, <ORGANIZATION> and others. All Rights Reserved.

    C. In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. Also, each Contributor must agree that the additions and/or changes are intended to be a Contribution. Once a Contribution is contributed, it may not thereafter be revoked.

    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Distributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for Contributors. Therefore, if a Distributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Distributor ("Commercial Distributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Distributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Distributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Distributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Distributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

    For example, a Distributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Distributor is then a Commercial Distributor. If that Commercial Distributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Distributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Distributor would have to defend claims against the Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Distributor must pay those damages.

    5. NO WARRANTY

    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

    7. EXPORT CONTROL

    Recipient agrees that Recipient alone is responsible for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries).

    8. GENERAL

    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

    LUCENT may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one other than LUCENT has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

    This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

b.  in the case of each Contributor, 
 
1. changes to the Program, and 
2. additions to the Program;

This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder. 
 
c. Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program. 
 
d. Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement. 
 
3. REQUIREMENTS 

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that: 

a. it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and The Open Group Agreement; and  

b. its license agreement:  

1. effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose; 

2. effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION 

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:  

a)       promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and  

b)       allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations.  

The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense. 

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. 

5. NO WARRANTY 

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. 

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY 

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 

7. GENERAL 

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.  

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.  

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.  

METRO LINK may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number.

3. Distribution Obligations.

     3.1. Application of License.
     The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
     governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
     Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
     distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
     of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
     copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
     distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
     version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
     License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
     an additional document offering the additional rights described in
     Section 3.5.

     3.2. Availability of Source Code.
     Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
     made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
     either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
     Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
     Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
     Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
     months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
     (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
     has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
     ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
     Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

     3.3. Description of Modifications.
     You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
     file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
     the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
     the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
     Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
     Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
     Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
     origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
          (a) Third Party Claims.
          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
          intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
          granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
          Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
          distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
          party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
          know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
          the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
          Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
          Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
          (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
          reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
          Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

          (b) Contributor APIs.
          If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
          interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
          are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
          also include this information in the LEGAL file.

               (c)    Representations.
          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
          Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
          Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
          Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
          this License.

     3.5. Required Notices.
     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
     Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
     Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
     location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
     to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)
     You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
     Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
     for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
     rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to
     charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
     obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
     may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
     any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
     offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
     Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
     Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
     support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
     requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
     and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
     the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
     including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
     obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
     in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
     collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
     Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
     Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
     contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
     compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
     Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
     rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
     License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
     license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
     from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
     Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
     Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
     the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
     terms You offer.

     3.7. Larger Works.
     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
     not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
     Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
     requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
     License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
     statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
     the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
     describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
     must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
     be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
     extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
     sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
     understand it.

5. Application of this License.

     This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
     attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.

     6.1. New Versions.
     Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
     and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
     will be given a distinguishing version number.

     6.2. Effect of New Versions.
     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
     License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
     version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
     of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
     other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to
     Covered Code created under this License.

     6.3. Derivative Works.
     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
     only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
     governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that
     the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",
     "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
     license (except to note that your license differs from this License)
     and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
     contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
     Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
     Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
     Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
     this License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

     COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
     WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
     DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
     THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
     IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
     YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
     COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
     OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
     ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION.

     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
     such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
     sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
     survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
     nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
     shall survive.

     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
     claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
     or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
     You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:

     (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
     Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
     shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
     unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
     agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
     royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
     Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
     the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days
     of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
     mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
     is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
     Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
     the 60 day notice period specified above.

     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
     Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
     any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
     and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
     sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
     Participant.

     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
     alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
     by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
     into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
     license.

     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
     all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
     which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
     prior to termination shall survive termination.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
     DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
     OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
     ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
     CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
     WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
     COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
     INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
     LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
     RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
     PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
     EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
     THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

     The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
     48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
     software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
     terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
     C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
     all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
     rights set forth herein.

11. MISCELLANEOUS.

     This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
     matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
     unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
     necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
     California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
     any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
     With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,
     or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United
     States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be
     subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
     District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
     California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including
     without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and
     expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
     Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
     Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
     shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
     License.

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

     As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
     responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
     out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
     work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
     responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
     shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.

     Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
     "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial
     Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
     Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
     by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

non-exclusive license:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its

distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
Contributor:

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
    or

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
    Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
    its Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.

Python Software Foundation License Version 2
<<<<<<<<<<xilinx-separator>>>>>>>>>>
A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.
